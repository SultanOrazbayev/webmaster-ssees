Title: Ambiguity of Social Networks in Post-Communist Contexts
Abstract: The paper discusses three hypotheses. First, it introduces four ideal types of networks which are combined in the category of networks as used by social scientists. Four types result from the intersection of two implicit choices made about networks – networks are assumed to be either personal or impersonal, and are viewed either internally or externally. Thus, networks are understood in terms of sociability, access to resources, enabling structure, or social capital. Second, I argue that networks function in a fundamentally ambiguous way. They operate in their capacity of a safety net or survival kit, provide a ‘beating the system’ capacity or compensate for the system’s defects. At the same time networks provide constraints such as high costs of informal contract, limits on individual action, lock-in effects and the handicaps of social capital. Third, I illustrate differences between networks serving the economy of favors in Russia and networks serving the purposes of ‘network society.’

Title: Privatisation, corporate control and employment growth: evidence from a panel of large Polish firms, 1996-2002
Abstract: Using panel data on large Polish firms this paper examines the relationship between corporate control structures, sales growth and the determinants of employment change during the period 1996-2002. We find that privatised and de novo firms are the main drivers of employment growth and that, in the case of de novo firms, it is foreign ownership which underpins the result. Interestingly, we find that being privatised has a positive impact on employment growth but that this impact is concentrated within a range of three to six years after privatisation. In contrast with the findings of earlier literature, we find evidence that there are no systematic differences in employment response to negative sales growth across the ownership categories. On the other hand, employment in state firms is less responsive to positive sales growth. From these combined results we infer that the behaviour of state firms is constrained by both insider rent sharing and binding budget constraints. Consistent with this, we find that privatised companies, three to six years post-privatisation, are the firms for whom employment is most responsive to positive sales growth and as such, offer the best hope for rapid labour market expansion.

Title: Wage bargaining, privatisation, ability to pay, and outside options - evidence from Hungary
Abstract: This paper examines the determinants of short-term wage dynamics, using a sample of large Hungarian companies for the period of 1996-1999. We test the basic implications of an efficient contract model of bargaining between the incumbent employees and the managers, which we are unable to reject. In particular, there are structural differences between the ownership sectors consistent with our prior knowledge on relative bargaining strength and unionisation measures. Stronger bargaining position of workers leads to higher ability to pay elasticity of wages, and lower outside option elasticity. Our results indicate that while bargaining position of workers in domestic privatised firms may be weaker than in the state sector, the more robust difference relate to state sector workers versus the privatised firms with the majority foreign ownership. We examine several extensions. We augment the bargaining specification by controls related to workers' skills and find that the basic findings are robust to that. We take a closer look at the outside options of the workers. We find some interactive effects, where unemployment modify the impact of availability of rents on wages. We interpret our results as an indication that bargaining power of workers may be affected by changes in their outside options. We also experiment with one concise indicator of reservation wage which is closest to the theoretical model specification and combines sectoral wages, unemployment benefits and regional unemployment levels,. We found that measure performing well. Finally, we found that while responsiveness of wages towards ability to pay is higher in the state sector, variation in wage dynamics is lower. This may indicate some wage smoothing in the state sector, consistent with the preferences of employees.

Title: The Estonian organizations - the subjects of transformation
Abstract: Estonia stayed fifty years under the communist regime. This paper explores the transformation of Estonian organizations within the framework of the Leavitt's model of change where the process is analyzed from the perspective of four organizational elements: people, organizational goals, structure, and technology. In respect with the people the role of individuals is emphasized as well as the polarization of mindsets is discussed. The new era forced to clarify the organizational task because of market economy. The organizational structure does not change as fast as the other elements do and hierarchy considered being important. The formalization tactics (personnel selection and training) have gained new meaning in the process of transformation of organizations. The technology has varied due to the twofold possibilities- advantage to introduce the new informational technology and the usage of the old fashion machinery. Change of the society led to the change of organizations, which had the transformational nature. There was shown that all the elements of the organizations had the pressure to find new forms of existence.

Title: Revisiting Consumption Smoothing and the 1998 Russian Crisis
Abstract: Applying quantile regression techniques to Russian data we investigate the channels through which individuals experience changes in their well being. We find that married individuals in non-rural households with university-educated heads are less vulnerable to severe welfare shocks. For the most vulnerable individuals the labour market plays a key role in transmitting the effects of aggregate shocks through the unemployment channel whereas those individuals able to maintain their employment status are more able to cope with economic shocks. While increases in pension payments help individuals to cope with shocks, it transpires that vulnerable individuals rely more broadly on the support of relatives and the produce of their garden plots and dachas.

Title: Insurance company financial management by optimising premium level: the case of Poland
Abstract: The article, which falls within the terms of reference of insurance risk analysis, presents research on the death risk regional differentiation and its influence on the level of insurance and social security premiums. The article is divided into four parts. The first one describes probability of death as a measure of calculated death risk and presents synthetic results of death probability estimates for individual Polish voivodships. In the second part net life insurance premiums calculated separately for individual voivodships and premiums calculated with the average death risk factor for the entire territory of Poland are compared. Part three discusses the effect of the regional premium and death risk differentiation method on financial management of insurance companies indicating the value of the insurance fund established. The said fund has been calculated on the basis of the method presented and without the application of the regional premium differentiation method. In conclusion, recommendations are made concerning the possible application of the regional premium differentiation by insurance companies.

Title: Sustainability of the Estonian macroeconomic performance in the light of the EU membership
Abstract: For the new Member States of the EU, the question of choosing the optimal macroeconomic policy mix is rather complicated as these countries are all in the dynamic movement towards joining the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This implies a considerable change in macroeconomic policy environment. Many of the countries have to change their macroeconomic framework in order to meet the strict criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty and accompanying legislative acts (SGP). Although currency board arrangement and sound government finances have helped to stabilise Estonian economy during the transition, the aim of the current paper is to evaluate the sustainability of the Estonian macroeconomic policy in the light of the future developments, especially participation in the EMU. The analysis is based on the comparative performance of the Estonia with the EU15 and former accession countries. It gives an overview of the nominal convergence according to the rules laid down by EC Treaty on EMU convergence criteria. In the context of real convergence the set of criteria provided by the theory of Optimum Currency Areas are analysed, as these are expected to be fulfilled in order to guarantee sustainability and success of the region participating in the monetary union. The paper highlights the dilemmas to be faced between the nominal criteria and real expected performance of the acceding country using the example of Estonia.

Title: Autonomy and capacity: a state-centred approach to post-communist transition in Central Europe
Abstract: The paper examines state characteristics and their policy implications in five Central European post-communist countries. It argues that policies on macroeconomic stabilisation, privatisation and FDI had been shaped by state-society relations, which, in turn, had been affected by policy outcomes. Curiously, though, whereas structural and institutional developments exhibited a great deal of path-dependency in some countries, in others significant policy shifts took place. The conceptual tools of state capacity and autonomy are used to describe both dynamics, as well as to explain the spectacular variation in the role of FDI across the region.

Title: Job creation and job destruction in Estonia: labour reallocation and structural changes
Abstract: This paper documents and analyses gross job flows and their determinants in Estonia over the years 1995-2001, using a unique database from the Estonian Business Registry. This database contains all (including also micro and small firms) officially registered firms in Estonia, the total number being almost 52,000. There are several important findings in the paper. Our results show that job flows (job creation and job destruction rates) have been extremely high in Estonia and are comparable to the levels documented for the US. These rates have not decreased recently, although worker flows (transitions between labour market states) have dropped. We also found that the firm-specific component in job flows excess of employment change had relatively lower importance than in western studies due to the emergence of small and medium-sized enterprises and labour reallocation between the economic sectors. The high inter-sectoral mobility has helped maintain high levels of job flows, while both are high also due to a favourable institutional environment, especially due to low start-up costs and a large share of micro enterprises.

Title: Creative destruction and transition: the effects of firm entry and exit on productivity growth in Estonia
Abstract: This paper presents one of the first studies of firm demographics in Estonia, particularly, on the processes of firm entry and exit as well as survival analysis of new firms. Also decompositions of productivity change into components consisting of resource reallocation, firm entry and exit, and productivity growth within continuing firms is carried out. Our results, derived from a novel database of the population of Estonian firms, show that firm turnover has been rather high in Estonia during the observed period from 1995 to 2001, resulting from low institutional entry barriers and emergence of the SME sector. The high survival rates for new firms and surviving firms' relatively fast growth could reflect their relatively high productivity compared to incumbent firms and changes in the sectoral structure of the economy. The decomposition of productivity change shows that the high productivity growth has been mostly from within-firm productivity growth (e.g. the adoption of new production technologies and organizational changes), but the reallocation of production factors (especially the exit of low productivity units) has played an important role as well.

Title: Inherited labour hoarding, insiders and employment growth. Panel data results: Poland, 1996-2002
Abstract: Using panel data pertaining to large Polish (non-financial) firms this paper examines the determinants of employment change during the period 1996-2002. Paying particular attention to the asymmetry hypothesis we investigate the impact of own wages, outside wages, output growth, regional characteristics and sectoral affiliation on the evolution of employment. In keeping with the 'right to manage' model we find that employment dynamics are not affected negatively by alternative wages. Furthermore, in contrast to the early transition period, we find evidence that employment levels respond to positive sales growth (in all but state firms). The early literature, (e.g. Kőllő, 1998) found that labour hoarding lowered employment elasticities in the presence of positive demand shocks. Our findings suggest that inherited labour hoarding may no longer be a factor. We argue that the present pattern of employment adjustment is better explained by the role of insiders. This tentative conclusion is hinged on the contrasting behaviour of state and privatised companies and the similar behaviour of privatised and new private companies. We conclude that lower responsiveness of employment to both positive and negative changes in revenue in state firms is consistent with the proposition that rent sharing by insiders is stronger in the state sector.

Title: Growth of Enterprises through Alliances in Central Europe
Abstract: The paper explores the role of alliances in central European countries from the perspective of growth of enterprises. The analysis is based on a comparative overview of 26 cases studies of enterprises in Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary which have alliances with foreign partners. Most of the alliances are production alliances, especially subcontracting, that are combined with several other types of alliances, especially marketing agreements. The balance between generic expansion, alliances (networks), and mergers & acquisitions as modes of growth of enterprises reflects differences in firms' ability to control technology, access to market and finance. However, the final outcome does not seem to be a direct function of the ability of enterprises to control these three factors. The types and dynamics of alliances also reflect the political and legal situation of a country (privatisation, attitude towards FDI) as well as specific sectoral features in terms of technology, finance and markets. Features of alliances are in that context shaped through the interaction between firm-specific factors and capabilities, sector- and country-specific factors.

Title: Ownership Characteristics and Access to Finance: Evidence from a Survey of Large Privatised Companies in Hungary and Poland
Abstract: We examine financial constraints and forms of finance used for investment, by analysing survey data on 157 large privatised companies in Hungary and Poland for the period 1998 - 2000. The Bayesian analysis using Gibbs sampling is carried out to obtain inferences about the sample companies' access to finance from a model for categorical outcome. By applying alternative measures of financial constraints we find that foreign companies, companies that are part of domestic industrial groups and enterprises with concentrated ownership are all less constrained in their access to finance. Moreover, we identify alternative modes of finance since different corporate control and past performance characteristics influence the sample firms' choice of finance source. In particular, while being industry-specific, the access to domestic credit is positively associated with company size and past profitability. Industrial group members tend to favour bond issues as well as sells-offs of assets as appropriate types of finance for their investment programmes. Preferences for raising finance in the form of equity are associated with share concentration in a non-monotonic way, being most prevalent in those companies where the dominant owner holds 25%-49% of shares. Close links with a leading bank not only increase the possibility of bond issues but also appear to facilitate access to non-banking sources of funds, in particular, to finance supplied by industrial partners. Finally, reliance on state finance is less likely for the companies whose profiles resemble the case of unconstrained finance, namely, for companies with foreign partners, companies that are part of domestic industrial groups and companies with a strategic investor. Model implications also include that the use of state funds is less likely for Polish than for Hungarian companies.
