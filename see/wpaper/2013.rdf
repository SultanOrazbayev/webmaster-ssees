Title: Assessing the Impact of the Maternity Capital Policy in Russia Using a Dynamic Model of Fertility and Employment
Abstract: With declining population and fertility rates below replacement levels, Russia is currently facing a demographic crisis. Starting in 2007, the federal government has pursued an ambitious pro-natalist policy. Women who give birth to at least two children are entitled to "maternity capital" assistance ($11,000). In this paper we estimate a structural dynamic programming model of fertility and labor force participation in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the policy. We find that the program increased long-run fertility by about 0.15 children per woman.

Title: Making the Most of High Inflation
Abstract: The paper analyses inflationary real effects in situation where there are frequent episodes of high inflation. It is conjectured with the increase in high inflation, and when differences between the expected and output-neutral inflation become large, output stimulation through inflationary shocks is more effective than otherwise. It is shown that this conjecture is valid for most countries with high inflation episodes, where inflation is greater than 4.8% for at least 25% of quarterly observations. This leads to a simple policy prescription that anti-inflationary monetary decisions should be undertaken in periods where the expected inflation exceeds output-neutral.

Title: Lerner meets Gravity
Abstract: We examine the linkages between import policy and export performance, extending classic macroeconomic trade e ffects to more recent concepts from the modern literature on gravity models. We also examine these e ffects empirically with a panel of global and bilateral trade spanning 15 years. Our emphasis on the role of import policy (i.e. tari ffs) of exporters as an explanation of trade volumes contrasts with the recent emphasis on importer policy in the gravity literature. It also reinforces the growing body of evidence on the importance of economic environmental (policy and infrastructure) conditions in explaining relative export performance.
