Title: Utility payments in Ukraine: affordability, subsidies and arrears
Abstract: Transition has led to a significant increase in the severity and incidence of poverty in Eastern Europe. One important aspect of poverty is access to, and the affordability of, basic services like electricity, heat and water. This paper provides evidence on this issue from the Ukraine Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS). The paper identifies considerable differences in both access and affordability between different localities in Ukraine. Social protection measures can help to alleviate affordability constraints, but the analysis finds that social support is not well targeted. The currently low tariffs prevent an escalation of affordability problems but constraints nevertheless exist. Many households have accumulated substantial arrears as a consequence, although non-payment is a complex issue and not solely a function of affordability.

Title: Voluntary Enrolment In The Peruvian Private Pension System
Abstract:  One of the important aspects in the design of social protection is coverage. In Peru, as in most Latin American countries, social security participation is compulsory only for workers in the ‘formal’ sector. We investigate the determinants of voluntary enrolment in the private pension system in Peru. We found that a selected group of people i.e. married males (with more than high school education) living in high income households and with other family members already participating in the pension system, have a higher likelihood of participation. Although the results suggest that family based safety nets might be substitutes for pension participation, pension coverage and poverty relief remain as challenges for government involvement.

Title: Why are Optimistic Entrepreneurs Successful? An Application of the Regulatory Focus Theory
Abstract:  Does entrepreneurial optimism affect business performance? Using a unique data set based on repeated survey design, we investigate this relationship empirically. Our measures of ‘optimism’ and ‘realism’ are derived from comparing the turnover growth expectations of 133 owners-managers with the actual outcomes one year later. Our results indicate that entrepreneurial optimists perform significantly better in terms of profits than pessimists. Moreover, it is the optimist-realist combination that performs best. We interpret our results using the regulatory focus theory.
