Title: Voluntary Enrolment In The Peruvian Private Pension System
Abstract:  One of the important aspects in the design of social protection is coverage. In Peru, as in most Latin American countries, social security participation is compulsory only for workers in the ‘formal’ sector. We investigate the determinants of voluntary enrolment in the private pension system in Peru. We found that a selected group of people i.e. married males (with more than high school education) living in high income households and with other family members already participating in the pension system, have a higher likelihood of participation. Although the results suggest that family based safety nets might be substitutes for pension participation, pension coverage and poverty relief remain as challenges for government involvement.

Title: Why are Optimistic Entrepreneurs Successful? An Application of the Regulatory Focus Theory
Abstract:  Does entrepreneurial optimism affect business performance? Using a unique data set based on repeated survey design, we investigate this relationship empirically. Our measures of ‘optimism’ and ‘realism’ are derived from comparing the turnover growth expectations of 133 owners-managers with the actual outcomes one year later. Our results indicate that entrepreneurial optimists perform significantly better in terms of profits than pessimists. Moreover, it is the optimist-realist combination that performs best. We interpret our results using the regulatory focus theory.
