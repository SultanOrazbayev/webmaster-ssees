Title: Brain drain with FDI gain? Factor mobility between Eastern and Western Europe
Abstract: A growing strand of literature highlights that skilled migration may favour growth-enhancing technology transfer, trade and foreign direct investments between the source and the host economies of migrants (network effects). We explore a specific channel through which the possible "diaspora externality" associated with the current emigration of both poorly and highly educated workers may occur: the removal of informational, cultural and reputational barriers that could prevent firms of high-income countries from investing in the low-income immigrants' economies of origin. By means of a straightforward gravity specification, we take a fragmentation and multinational production model in the fashion of Venables (1999) to the data. The focus is on the mobility of capital and workers between the advanced European Union countries (EU15) and New Member States (NMS) in the 1994-2005 period. The evidence points to a significant correlation between the volume of EU15's activities in NMS and the total stock of NMS' own-migrants in the EU15 economies. Furthermore, the larger is the share of skilled workers in the total emigration stock the larger is the inward FDI flow.

Title: Party-system institutionalization and democracy: the case of Russia
Abstract: Party-system institutionalization and its implications for democratic consolidation is an important sub-field in the study of political parties. The conventional view is that an institutionalized party system is better for democracy than an under-institutionalized one. This article considers the case of party-system institutionalization and democracy in Russia, and its implications for our understanding of the relationship between party-system institutionalization and democracy. The analysis finds, contrary to the expectations of the literature, that this relationship has been inverse in Russia i.e. as the party system has institutionalized democracy has declined. The Russian case shows that the link between party-system institutionalization and democracy does not necessarily hold and suggests that the conditions in which party-system institutionalization has democratizing effects need to be specified more precisely.

Title: Hierarchy of Governance Institutions and the Pecking Order of Privatisation: Central-Eastern Europe and Central Asia Reconsidered
Abstract: We discuss property rights, corporate governance frameworks and privatisation outcomes in the Central Eastern Europe and Central Asia (CEECA) region. We argue that while CEECA still suffers from deficient 'higher order' institutions, this is not attracting sufficient attention of international institutions like EBRD and World Bank, which focus on 'lower order' indicators. We discuss factors that may alleviate the negative impact of the weakness in institutional environment and argue for the pecking order of privatisation, where equivalent privatisation is given a priority, but speed is not compromised.

Title: Macroeconomic Stability, Governance and Growth: Empirical Lessons from the Post-Communist Transition
Abstract: Using panel data for the period 1989-2006 we revisit the empirics of economic growth in the context of the post-communist transition. We pay particular attention to the mechanisms of causation and to the potential endogeneity of the macroeconomic stability indicators considered to be important in the existing literature. Carefully employing a variety of econometric techniques we consistently find that macroeconomic instability is bad for economic growth. We find some evidence that institutions of governance are important for economic growth through their influence on the macroeconomic environment. That is, good institutions are conducive to macroeconomic stability which in turn positively impacts upon economic growth. We also find, in contrast with other work, that investments in education have had a strong positive impact on growth in transition while other 'standard' economic growth determinants remain less important. These findings are shown to be robust to a variety of econometric approaches, specifications and time spans.

Title: Utility payments in Ukraine: affordability, subsidies and arrears
Abstract: Transition has led to a significant increase in the severity and incidence of poverty in Eastern Europe. One important aspect of poverty is access to, and the affordability of, basic services like electricity, heat and water. This paper provides evidence on this issue from the Ukraine Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS). The paper identifies considerable differences in both access and affordability between different localities in Ukraine. Social protection measures can help to alleviate affordability constraints, but the analysis finds that social support is not well targeted. The currently low tariffs prevent an escalation of affordability problems but constraints nevertheless exist. Many households have accumulated substantial arrears as a consequence, although non-payment is a complex issue and not solely a function of affordability.

Title: Voluntary Enrolment In The Peruvian Private Pension System
Abstract:  One of the important aspects in the design of social protection is coverage. In Peru, as in most Latin American countries, social security participation is compulsory only for workers in the ‘formal’ sector. We investigate the determinants of voluntary enrolment in the private pension system in Peru. We found that a selected group of people i.e. married males (with more than high school education) living in high income households and with other family members already participating in the pension system, have a higher likelihood of participation. Although the results suggest that family based safety nets might be substitutes for pension participation, pension coverage and poverty relief remain as challenges for government involvement.

Title: Why are Optimistic Entrepreneurs Successful? An Application of the Regulatory Focus Theory
Abstract:  Does entrepreneurial optimism affect business performance? Using a unique data set based on repeated survey design, we investigate this relationship empirically. Our measures of ‘optimism’ and ‘realism’ are derived from comparing the turnover growth expectations of 133 owners-managers with the actual outcomes one year later. Our results indicate that entrepreneurial optimists perform significantly better in terms of profits than pessimists. Moreover, it is the optimist-realist combination that performs best. We interpret our results using the regulatory focus theory.
