Title: Are systems of innovation in Eastern Europe efficient?
Abstract: This paper explores the determinants of the productivity in the countries of Eastern Europe (EE) through the perspective of ‘narrow’ and ‘broad’ national systems of innovation (NSI). Based on panel econometrics it examines the extent to which systems in EE could be considered ‘(in)efficient’. Our results suggest that the EE countries have lower levels of productivity than might be expected given their research and development (R&D), innovation and production capabilities. The inefficiencies of ‘broad’ NSI are compounded by the inefficiencies of ‘narrow’ NSI in terms of generating numbers of science and technology publications and resident patents relative to R&D employment, compared to the rest of the world. Our results point to an important distinction between technology and production capability as the drivers of productivity improvements, and provide some policy implications.

Title: The Russian corporation: patterns of behavior during the crisis
Abstract: This paper considers the behavior patterns of Russian firms before and during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. To facilitate comparison, we define three main groups of actors at the firm level in the Russian economy – large, politically connected companies; mid-size firms that expanded in the 2000s with the help of administrative support, and successful mid-size firms driven by market factors. Many of the large companies practiced highly risky financial policy and experienced a decrease in efficiency before the crisis, and the managers and owners of some Russian firms have been engaging in opportunistic behavior during the crisis; the forms and causes of this behavior are analyzed here. We conclude by proposing some policy implications with emphasis on supporting successful mid-size firms driven by market factors.

Title: Foreign direct investments distribution in the Russian Federation: do spatial effects matter?
Abstract: In this paper we explore the hypothesis of spatial effects in the distribution of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) across Russian regions. We make use of a model, which describes FDI inflows as resulting from an agglomeration effect (the level of FDI in a given region depends positively on the level of FDI received by the regions in its neighbourhood) and remoteness effect (the distance of each Russian regions from the most important outflows countries). Considering a panel of 68 Russian regions over the period 2000-2004 we find that the two effects play a significant role in determining FDI inflows towards Russia. The two effects are also robust to the inclusion of other widely used explanatory variables impacting the level of FDI towards countries or regions (e.g. surrounding market potential, infrastructures, investment climate).
