Title: Governance Structures in Russian manufacturing: assessment using sample survey data
Abstract: The analysis of governance structures in Russian manufacturing does not only enable exploring the industrial organization and upgrading of companies, but also brings forefront the transaction costs faced by market participants. From this perspective, it is important to examine Russian industries, since models of organizational structure have been developing in Russia only within the last 20 years, under the influence of transaction costs associated with the transition economy. Despite the importance of governance structures within the framework of analysis of markets, competition, and inter-firm cooperation in transition economy, the model of Russian organizational structure has been studied insufficiently. The main objective of this work is to fill the gaps in studies of alternative governance mechanisms in Russian industries, and to review organization and behavior of enterprises as a part of hierarchical, market, and hybrid models. The empirical analysis is based on the data obtained from interviews of Russia’s mid-sized manufacturing enterprises. Preliminary results show that, first, in contrary to expectation, hierarchical governance does not prevail in the manufacturing industries, and second, governance structures affect organization of corporate control, willingness to priceand non-price competition, investment decisions, incentives and possibilities to upgrade and also the assessment of contract risk and contract protection in directions predicted by institutional theory and theory of value chain.

Title: Russian Manufacturing Revisited: Industrial Enterprises at the Start of the Crisis
Abstract: The paper is based on the findings of a major project by the Higher School of Economics Institute for Industrial and Market Studies (IIMS) to monitor competitiveness of manufacturing enterprises. The study focuses on the drivers and dynamics of business competitiveness, including changes in firms' behavior during the period before the crisis (2005-2008). The primary issue was to find out what firms and to what extent succeeded in capitalizing on the strong economic growth before the crisis to catch up with their competitors and gain a sustainable competitive position in the market. What was driving output increases and enhanced production efficiency? What were the impediments to this process?

Title: Impact of financial crises on poverty in developing world: an empirical approach
Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a cross-country perspective to analyze the short term effects of currency, banking and debt crises on poverty. We employ multivariate fixed effects panel data analysis in order to examine whether and to what extent different types of financial crises impact the poverty headcount ratio and the poverty gap (as measured by the World Bank). Our findings suggest that out of the three categories of financial crises we identify, it is currency crises that most significantly exacerbate both the incidence and depth of poverty in the short run. We find evidence that banking crises are associated with an increase in the depth of poverty but not the incidence (however this effect tends to be short-lived), while, our analysis shows no direct effect of sovereign debt crises on short term poverty.

Title: Knowledge source preferences as determinants of strategic entrepreneurial orientation
Abstract: In the knowledge intensive context, firms’ capacity to integrate external and internal sources of knowledge becomes an important competitive advantage and may distinguish entrepreneurial from conservative firms. This paper explores the proposition that differences in strategic entrepreneurial orientation (EO) across firms may be significantly determined by differences in firms’ preferences regarding knowledge sources. Our research is based on 208 firms operating in knowledge intensive industries in six Central and East European countries (CEEC). We identified three types of firms in terms of patterns of sources of knowledge: external R&D knowledge based firms, in-house knowledge based firms and value chain dependent firms. By using different proxies or different dimensions of EO, we have found that the EO is strongest in firms based on external knowledge. Firms with inhouse based knowledge have an intermediate strength of the EO, and firms dependent on value chains are the least entrepreneurially oriented. We have also found moderate support for grouping different proxies of EO into three dimensions identified in literature – innovativeness, pro-activeness and risk-taking. Value chain firms are not pro-active, have the lowest innovativeness, and are the most risk averse. External knowledge based firms are the most active in all three dimensions of EO, while inhouse knowledge based firms are in an intermediate position. Our results point to strong systemic features of entrepreneurial activities; i.e., EO is inherently different in different sub-populations of firms depending on their patterns of sources of knowledge. It seems that these patterns operate as a moderating factor between performance and the EO, which explains mixed results from the literature.

Title: Integration or regionalization: regional industrial specialization in Russia
Abstract: The article is devoted to the trends and determinants of the transformation of Russian regions' industrial specialization during the period of economic growth. Using the methodology of statistic and econometric analysis it is tested whether the tendency of diversification dominates the tendency of regions' industrial specialization in 1997-2004 and whether there is a convergence of Russian regions' industrial structures. The considered factors of industries' development in a particular location include the initial industrial structure, inter- and intraregional technologic links between industries, quality of investment climate, R&D potential, international competition.

Title: Legitimacy of inequality and the stability of income distributions in Poland
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to apply hypotheses derived from theories of legitimacy and distributive justice to patterns of stability in income distribution in Poland. The hypotheses specify conditions under which income differences become legitimated. The question about the conditions of legitimacy of the differences is especially interesting in the Polish context, given steady increase in the amount of inequality after 1989. Data from Polish General Social Survey are then used to see if the hypotheses are consistent with empirical observation.

Title: Entrepreneurship in transition economies: the role of institutions and generational change
Abstract: The transition economies have lower rates of entrepreneurship than are observed in most developed and developing market economies. The difference is even more marked in the countries of the former Soviet Union than those of Central and Eastern Europe. We link these differences partly with the legacy of communist planning, which needs to be replaced with formal market-supporting institutions. But many of these developments have now taken place, yet entrepreneurial activity still remains low in many places. To analyse this longer term issue, we highlight the necessarily slow pace of development of new informal institutions and the corresponding social attitudes, notably rebuilding the generalised trust. We argue that changes are even slower in the former Soviet Union than Central and Eastern Europe because communist rule was much longer, leading to a lack of institutional memory. We posit that changes in informal institutions may be therefore delayed until after full generational change.

Title: Mass privatisation and the post-communist mortality crisis: is there really a relationship
Abstract: We reexamine the recent, well-publicized claim that "rapid mass privatisation [of state-owned enterprises]... was a crucial determinant of differences in adult mortality trends in post-communist countries" (Stuckler, King and McKee, 2009). Our analysis shows that the estimated correlation of privatization and mortality in country-level data is not robust to recomputing the mass-privatization measure, to assuming a short lag for economic policies to affect mortality, and to controlling for country-specific mortality trends. Further, in an analysis of the determinants of mortality in Russian regions, we find no evidence that privatization increased mortality during the early 1990s. Finally, we reanalyze the relationship between privatization and unemployment in postcommunist countries, showing that there is little support for the proposed mechanism by which privatization might have increased mortality.

Title: Russian banking: a comeback of the state
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to assess the size of public sector within the Russian banking industry. We identify and classify at least 78 state-influenced banks. We distinguish between banks that are majority-owned by federal executive authorities or Central Bank of Russia, by sub-federal (regional and municipal) authorities, by state-owned enterprises and banks, and by "state corporations". We estimate their combined market share to have reached 56% of total assets by July 1, 2009. Banks indirectly owned by public capital are the fastest-growing group. Concentration is increasing within the public sector of the industry, with the top five state-controlled banking groups in possession of over 49% of assets. We observe a crowding out and erosion of domestic private capital, whose market share is shrinking from year to year. Several of the largest state-owned banks now constitute a de facto intermediate tier at the core of the banking system. We argue that the direction of ownership change in Russian banking is different from that in CEE countries.

Title: Did Mass Privatisation really increase Post-Communist male mortality?
Abstract: A recent article in the Lancet, by David Stuckler, Larry King and Martin McKee, investigated anew the fluctuations in adult male mortality rates that have come to characterise the so-called post-communist mortality crisis. Adopting a cross-country, time-series perspective the authors examined how the economic policy strategies of the 1990s impacted upon observed fluctuations in mortality. They conclude that the adoption of a strategy of rapid (mass) privatisation contributed to the adverse mortality trends. We subject that finding to closer scrutiny using the same data from which the Stuckler et al claim stems. We find that their claim that mass privatisation adversely affected male mortality trends in the post-Communist world does not stand up to closer examination. It is not supported empirically and is at odds with what we know about both transition in the post-communist world and about health trends over time in this region.
