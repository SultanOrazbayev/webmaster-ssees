Title: The Political Economy of Crisis Adjustment in Central and Eastern Europe
Abstract: The fall of communism in 1989 across Central-Eastern Europe (CEE) has ushered in a decade of transitologists. Epitomized in EBRD’s annual Transition Reports, international institutions, global academic community and observers at large have sought to analyse, theorize and advise governments on the building of capitalist democracies from the ruins of socialist command economies (see de Batt, 1990; de Melo et al., 1996; Åslund, 2002; Dylon & Wykoff, 2002). By the 2000s, transitology gave way to comparative analysis, as scholars of various theoretical backgrounds argued for the formation of substantively different varieties of capitalism in the post-communist region (Cernat, 2006; Lane & Myant, 2007; Bohle & Greskovits, 2007; Drahokoupil, 2009; Drahokoupil & Myant, 2011). The 2008/9 financial crisis has opened up new avenues for research, particularly how the different political economies in CEE adjust to external economic shocks. Building on the existing literature, this article begins by proposing a theoretical framework for an analysis of the process of crisis adjustment in CEE with a view to exploring two of its dimensions. The first is economic: has there been an economic recovery and if so, what were its drivers and beneficiaries? The second is concerned with the social costs: how was the burden of fiscal adjustment that accompanied the crisis distributed? Ultimately, the article seeks to identify the implications of this episode for the East European variants of capitalism.

Title: Modernization through large S&T projects: Assessing Russia’s Drive for Innovation-Led Development via Skolkovo Innovation Centre
Abstract: ‘Skolkovo’ innovation city near Moscow is Russia’s latest high-profile manifestation of a policy shift towards diversification and innovation based growth. This paper aims to understand the institutional, historical and comparative contexts at an early stage when implementation in Skolkovo has just begun. It also aims to analyse the opportunities and challenges offered by Skolkovo in a comparative perspective by using a framework that evaluates Skolkovo’s early developments in terms of the extent it can contribute to a Russian system of innovation. We aim to demonstrate the value of academic discourse in policy issues, arguably an indispensable input into the ex-ante evaluation of state modernization projects. Our argument is that Skolkovo is meant to be a de facto ‘mission oriented innovation eco-system’ which is quite a new type of challenge for Russia. We outline the broad systemic obstacles facing Skolkovo as well as the opportunities for its growth.

Title: China and Russia: Institutional Coherence between the Banking Systems
Abstract: We use statistical data from 2000 to 2013 to compare the macro-level structure and the core institutions of the banking systems in China and Russia. Our main hypothesis is that, differences in the absolute size and socio-cultural features notwithstanding, these two systems are typologically similar. We consider the institutional structure, the market structure and concentration, the industrial policy of the government, and the banks’ involvement in the financing of the non-financial economy. We find both similarities and differences, however in dynamics the trend towards convergence prevails. In both countries, we see a hierarchical multi-tier banking system headed by a few core state-controlled banks. These combine commercial activities with the activity of a development institution. Regardless of the nominal form of bank ownership, the government exerts influence on the lending decisions and market behavior of banks. We argue that the case of banking in China and Russia provides empirical proof to the macrosociological theory of institutional matrices. We refer in particular to the needed proportion between the dominant and complementary institutions. Whereas China has been carefully seeking a sustainable balance, Russia in the 1990s grossly overshot with liberalization and now reverts to the underlying long-term trend. China has currently become Russia's donor for institutional innovations in the credit system design.

Title: Risk and Uncertainty: Macroeconomic Perspective
Abstract: The paper discusses main concepts and definitions related to macroeconomic uncertainty as operational concept. It proposes classifications of uncertainty according to areas of application and measurements. Properties of different methodologies of assessing uncertainty used in empirical analysis are discussed. The paper also analyses positive and negative aspects of particular methods and illustrates one of the most relevant problems, which is the biasness of the experts’ based assessments, by the analysis of the National Bank of Poland Survey of Professional Forecasters. A simple uncertainty indicator based on forecast errors for the analysis of inflation uncertainty in Poland is computed and evaluated.
