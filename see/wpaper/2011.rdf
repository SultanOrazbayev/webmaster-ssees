Title: Entrepreneurial Propensity of Innovation Systems
Abstract: This paper develops an analytical framework, namely the concept of entrepreneurial propensity of innovation systems by integrating knowledge intensive entrepreneurship (KIE) and innovation system (IS) concepts. It first uses a composite index methodology to measure knowledge intensive entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial opportunities at the national level. It then assesses the influence of the system's complementary activities on the emergence of KIE by OLS regressions and structural equation modeling (SEM). We argue that KIE is a systemic feature of IS and that new knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship are inseparable elements of a dynamic IS. The results show that countries with more developed EO tend to have a high correlation between KIE and entrepreneurial opportunities (EO) reflecting the systemic feature of this relationship. . This paper develops conceptually and empirically the notion of the entrepreneurial propensity of innovation system and provides empirical evidence that institutions affect entrepreneurial experimentation not only directly but more via technology and markets.

Title: Industrial Associations as a Channel of Business-Government Interactions in an Imperfect Institutional Environment: The Russian Case
Abstract: International lessons from emerging economies suggest that business associations may provide an effective channel of communication between the government and the private sector. This function of business associations may become still more important in transition economies, where old mechanisms for coordination of enterprise activities have been destroyed, but the new ones have not been established yet. In this context, Russian experience is a matter of interest, because Russia was regarded for a long time as a striking example of state failures and market failures. Consequently, the key point of our study was a description of the role and place of business associations in the present-day Russian economy and their interaction with member companies and bodies of state administration. Relying on the survey data of 957 manufacturing firms, conducted in 2009 we found that business associations are more frequently joined by larger companies, firms located in regional capital cities, and firms active in investment and innovation. By contrast, business associations tend to be less frequently joined by business groups' subsidiaries and firms that were non-responsive about their respective ownership structures. Our regression analysis has also confirmed that business associations are a component of what Frye (2002) calls an "elite exchange" - although only on regional and local levels. These "exchanges" imply that members of business associations, on the one hand, more actively assist regional and local authorities in social development of their regions, and on the other hand, they more often receive support from authorities. However, this effect is insignificant in terms of support from the federal government. In general, our results allow us to believe that at present, business associations (especially the industry-wide and "leading" ones) consolidate the most active, advanced companies and act as collective representatives of their interests. For this reason, business associations can be regarded as interface units between the authorities and businesses and as a possible instrument for promotion of economic development.

Title: Entrepreneurship, Social Capital, And Institutions: Social And Commercial Entrepreneurship Across Nations
Abstract: We model and test the relationship between social and commercial entrepreneurship drawing on social capital theory. We propose that the country prevalence rate of social entrepreneurship is an indicator of constructible nation-level social capital and enhances the likelihood of individual commercial entry. We further posit that both social and commercial entrepreneurial entry is facilitated by certain formal institutions, namely strong property rights and (low) government activism, albeit the latter impacts each of these types of entrepreneurship differently. We apply bivariate discrete choice multi-level modelling to population-representative samples in 47 countries and find support for these hypotheses.

Title: Institutional Determinants of New Firm Entry in Russia: a Crossregional Analysis
Abstract: We analyse a micro-panel data set to investigate the effect of regional institutional environment and economic factors on Russian new firm entry rates across time, industries and regions. The paper builds on novel databases and exploits inter-regional variation in a large number of institutional variables. We find entry rates across industries in Russia are not especially low by international standards and are correlated with entry rates in developed market economies, as well as with institutional environment and firm size. Furthermore, industries that, for scale or technological reasons, are characterised by higher entry rates experience lower entry within regions affected subject to political change. A higher level of democracy enhances entry rates for small sized firms but reduces them for medium or large ones.
