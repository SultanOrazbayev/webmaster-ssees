Title: Entrepreneurial Dynamics and Higher Education Institutions: Evidence from the Post-Communist World
Abstract: Drawing on the institutional and regional entrepreneurship literature this study develops a conceptual framework to analyse the impact of higher education institutions on entrepreneurial dynamics across the cities of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) during 1995-2008. Extending upon Scott (1995) and Stenholm's (2011) multi-pillar institutional concept, we posit that higher education institutions may influence entrepreneurial dynamics through various channels such as (1) the human capital development; (2) shaping a system of societal values and norms which cultivate a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship; (3) affecting perceptions of the knowledge and skills necessary to start up a business; and (4) knowledge spillovers. The empirical counterpart of this study utilizes a unique dataset to study education institutions as a driving force behind the growth in stock of small businesses, employing the System Generalised Method of Moments technique. We show that while formally constructed within the regulative pillar and mandated by national laws on education, higher education institutions are embedded in the other three pillars, notably normative, cognitive and conducive, to foster entrepreneurial dynamics. This embeddedness of higher education institutions within all four institutional pillars and their ability to affect entrepreneurial dynamics through these multiple institutional dimensions means they play an important role in explaining entrepreneurial dynamics in the region.

Title: Which Institutions Encourage Entrepreneurial Growth Aspirations?
Abstract: We develop entrepreneurship and institutional theory to explain entrepreneurial growth aspirations across individuals and institutional contexts. Our framework generates hypotheses at the national level about the negative impact of higher levels of corruption, weaker property rights and greater government activity on entrepreneurs' aspirations to increase employment. Also we explore whether, at the micro level, knowing other entrepreneurs compensates for weaknesses in institutions. We test these hypotheses using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor surveys in 42 countries for 2001-2006, applying a multilevel estimation framework. We find support for our main hypotheses but intellectual property rights are found to have no explanatory power.

Title: Corruption and Firm Growth: Evidence from China
Abstract: Corruption is one of the most pervasive obstacles to economic and social development. However, in the existing literature it appears that corruption seems to be less harmful in some countries than in others. The most striking examples are well known as the "East Asian paradox": countries displaying exceptional growth records despite having thriving corruption cultures. The aim of this paper is to explain the high corruption but fast economic growth puzzle in China by providing firm-level evidence of the relation between corruption and growth and investigating how financial development influences the former relationship. Our empirical results show that corruption is likely to contribute to firms' growth. We further highlight the substitution relationship between corruption and financial development on firm growth. This means that corruption appears not to be a vital constraint on firm growth if financial markets are underdeveloped. However, pervasive corruption deters firm growth where there are more developed financial markets. This implies that fast firm growth will not be observed until a later stage of China's development when financial markets are well-functioning and corruption is under control. Furthermore, the substitution relationship exists in the private and state-owned firms. Geographically, similar results can be seen in the Southeast and Central regions.

Title: Entrepreneurial Propensity of Innovation Systems
Abstract: This paper develops an analytical framework, namely the concept of entrepreneurial propensity of innovation systems by integrating knowledge intensive entrepreneurship (KIE) and innovation system (IS) concepts. It first uses a composite index methodology to measure knowledge intensive entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial opportunities at the national level. It then assesses the influence of the system's complementary activities on the emergence of KIE by OLS regressions and structural equation modeling (SEM). We argue that KIE is a systemic feature of IS and that new knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship are inseparable elements of a dynamic IS. The results show that countries with more developed EO tend to have a high correlation between KIE and entrepreneurial opportunities (EO) reflecting the systemic feature of this relationship. . This paper develops conceptually and empirically the notion of the entrepreneurial propensity of innovation system and provides empirical evidence that institutions affect entrepreneurial experimentation not only directly but more via technology and markets.
