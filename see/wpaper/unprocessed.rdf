Title: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITIVENESS IN SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE: ASSET OR LIABILITY FOR EU INTEGRATION? 
Abstract:  This paper explores the relationship between research and development (R&D) and
competitiveness of the SEE economies from the perspective of the EU integration and the
EU as a knowledge based economy. Specifically, paper addresses the question of
whether SEE is a potential asset or a liability in this process.
SEE countries are quite diverse in terms of levels of competitiveness, with visible effects
on the role of R&D which is confirmed by analysis of the demand and supply factors of
R&D. Although tentative, results show that innovation policy that takes account of the
supply and demand side factors of R&D is essential to knowledge based growth in the
SEE economies. This poses some limits to traditionally defined S&T policy as a sectoral
activity and calls for new approaches, which are discussed in the paper.

Title: Inequality, Democracy and Taxation: Lessons from the Post-Communist Transition
Abstract:  Using data for post-communist economies (1989-2002), we examine the determinants of 
income inequality. We
find a strong positive association between equality and tax collection but note that this relationship is 
significantly
stronger under authoritarian regimes than under democracies. We also discover that early 
macroeconomic
stabilisation resulted in lower inequality; we confirm that education fosters equality and find that larger 
countries
are prone to higher levels of inequality.

Title: National Systems of Innovation and Entrepreneurship: In Search of a Missing Link
Abstract:  The literature on national systems of innovation (NIS) has neglected the issue of
entrepreneurship because of several incompatibilities between the two notions.
The Schumpeterian legacy, the current person-centric view of entrepreneurship,
and methodological problems related to treating entrepreneurship at the macrolevel,
have made it difficult to integrate entrepreneurship into the NIS perspective.
At national level it is more appropriate to treat entrepreneurship as a ‘property’
(dimension) of NIS. In order to link NIS and entrepreneurship we must establish a common conceptual
basis. Our argument is that the functional view of NIS and entrepreneurship
presents a common basis for such an approach. We develop criteria for the
entrepreneurial NIS which we define as being those that can change balance
between individual and cooperative entrepreneurship; that enhance both the
opportunity and skill aspects of entrepreneurship; and that can balance generation
of uncertainty with support to business models and other organisations which pool
uncertainty. From the NIS perspective, we explain entrepreneurship as a systemic phenomenon
driven by complementarities between technological, market and institutional
opportunities. This framework builds on three research traditions in the
entrepreneurship/NIS literature (Schumpeterian, Kirznerian and Listian) which
jointly form a multi-level, multi-dimensional framework for understanding
entrepreneurship from a NIS perspective. This framework could be useful as a
heuristic for empirical research on entrepreneurship. Finally, we analyse policies
for entrepreneurship and find that they are highly dependent on underlying and
previously discussed conceptions of entrepreneurship.

Title: Convergence across Russian Regions: A Spatial Econometrics Approach
Abstract:  This paper analyses the process of convergence across the regions of Russia using spatial
econometrics tools in addition to the traditional ß-convergence techniques as derived from the
neoclassical theoretical setting. The spatial component appears to be non-negligible and,
consequently, conventional convergence estimates suffer a bias due to spatial dependence across
observations. Furthermore, variables such as hydrocarbon supply, openness to trade and FDI per
capita are found to have an unambiguous, positive and statistically significant impact on growth
(Results are also confirmed by the panel counterpart of the model. Estimates for this last are presented 
in Appendix E

Title: Knowledge Based Entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary: Results from 4 case studies.
Abstract:  This paper describes knowledge based entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary, in particular the growth and development process of 4 firms are studied:
Dekonta, an environmental services firm, Et netera, an IT services firm, both
operating in Czech Republic, along with a data recovery firm, Kurt, and a
biopharmaceutical firm, Solvo, both operating in Hungary. The objectives of the case
studies are to illustrate experiences of knowledge based entrepreneurship within a
transition environment in terms of their different growth and development paths.
By carrying out in depth case studies using semi structured interviews with the
founders, top management teams, core employees and key stakeholders in industrial
associations I am able to explain the growth process of entrepreneurial knowledge
based ventures. I assume an ecological view of the firm and examine the role of
internal, strategic, network and external factors in this development process. I propose
that the relative importance of these factors evolve over time from start up to
maturity. Moreover, I anticipate that there will be complementarities between these
factors in the spirit of Milgrom and Roberts (1995) and Von Tunzelmann (2003).  This approach 
should help us better understand the complex nature of
entrepreneurship. The key contributions of these case studies are the application of an ecological
conceptual framework to the development of knowledge based firms in Central and
Eastern Europe, and so the viability of this model is tested within the transition
environment. I follow the recommendations by Ireland et al. (2005) and introduce a
temporal element in order to analyse the shift in importance of the factors impacting
on firm development and growth, thus hoping to deal with some of the criticisms on
existing entrepreneurial research.

Title: Do Institutions Matter for Technological Change in
Transition Economies?  The Case of Russia’s 89 regions and republics.
Abstract:  We explore the impact of institutions on technological change in a transition
economy. We use regional panel data for Russia’s 89 regions and republics during the
period of recovery and growth from 1998 to 2004 to show the impact of large
variation in institutional development, ranging from full enforcement of property
rights in the Northwest to red belt Communist regimes in the southeast. We find an
unambiguous relationship between strong and sustained institutional development and
technological change. We provide one model proxying the quality of institutions by
the investment risk rating compiled by the rating agency ExpertRA Regions. (JEL:
