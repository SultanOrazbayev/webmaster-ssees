Title: Ownership Concentration, ‘Private Benefits of Control' and Debt Financing
Abstract:  Building on the ‘law and economics’ literature, this paper analyses corporate
governance implications of debt financing in an environment where a dominant owner is
able to extract ex ante ‘private benefits of control’. Ownership concentration may result in
lower efficiency, measured as a ratio of a firm’s debt to investment, and this effect depends
on the identity of the largest shareholder. Moreover, entrenched dominant shareholder(s)
may be colluding with fixed-claim holders in extracting ‘control premium’. One of possible
outcomes is a ‘crowding out’ of entrepreneurial firms from the debt market, and this is
supported by evidence from the transition economies.

Title: Corporate Governance and Control in Russian Banks
Abstract:  The Working Paper employs the paradigm of new institutional economics to examine 
peculiarities
of the Russian model of corporate governance and control in the banking sector. The study relies
upon theoretical as well as applied research of corporate governance in Russian commercial banks
featuring different forms of ownership. We focus on real interests of all stakeholders, namely bank and
stock market regulators, bank owners, investors, top managers and other insiders. The Anglo-
American concept of corporate governance, based on agency theory and implying outside investors’
control over banks through stock market, is found to bear limited relevance. We suggest some ways of
overcoming the gap between formal institutions of governance and the real life.

Title: Institutions and Entrepreneurship Development in Russia: A Comparative Perspective
Abstract:  In this paper we use a comparative perspective to explore the ways in which institutions and
networks have influenced entrepreneurial development in Russia. We utilize Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data to study the effects of the weak institutional
environment in Russia on entrepreneurship, comparing it first with all available GEM country
samples and second, in more detail, with Brazil and Poland. Our results suggest that Russia’s
institutional environment is important in explaining its relatively low levels of
entrepreneurship development, where the latter is measured in terms of both number of startups
and of existing business owners. In addition, Russia’s business environment and its
consequences for the role of business networks contribute to the relative advantage of
entrepreneurial insiders (those already in business) to entrepreneurial outsiders (newcomers)
in terms of new business start-ups.

Title: Oil and within region Inequality in Russia
Abstract:  Building on earlier work on regional inequality in Russia (Fedorov 2002; Gaddy and
Ickes 2005; Bradshaw 2006 and others) we investigate a novel line of research, i.e. demonstrate that
the regional oil and gas abundance is associated with high within-region inequality. We argue that
this phenomenon is amplified by the following two clusters of factors: on the one hand, by the
monopsonistic position of the extracting companies on the local labour markets coupled with
geographical relocation of rents via transfer pricing from the extracting regions to the companies
headquarters and central government bureaucracy, and, on the other hand, by reduction in financial
support for local communities offered by the extracting companies and by inadequate and illtargeted
transfers by the government.

Title: Entrepreneurship in Emerging Markets:  Which Institutions Matter?
Abstract: In this paper we combine a wide range of country-level institutional indicators with survey
data taken from the Global Enterprise Monitor on potential and actual entrepreneurial entry,
to investigate the role of the institutions as determinants of the entrepreneurial entry,
controlling for individual characteristics. We find that the two most robust institutional
features that affect entry are: the size of the financial sector and the protection of property
rights. In contrast, we find direct regulatory entry barriers to be insignificant. Interpreting
these effects jointly, we argue that the entrepreneurs are forward-looking: in the sense that
the business conditions under which they expect their firms to operate matter more than the
initial bureaucratic obstacles they have to overcome at time of entry.

Title: POLICIES FOR PROMOTING TECHNOLOGICAL CATCHING UP: TOWARDS POST-
WASHINGTON APPROACH
Abstract:  This paper analyses the evolution of policies for technology catch-up through three periods:
import-substitution, (augmented) Washington consensus and post-Washington period. We
analyse the dominant policy models and practices in each of these periods as co-evolving with
the dominant academic ideas, and changing the conditions for catching-up. We develop
several dimensions or building blocks that characterise the policies for technology catch-up.
These dimensions are used to characterise each of the three policy periods with the objective
of outlining the generic features of an emerging post-Washington approach to technology
catch-up policies in relation to past approaches.

Title: OLIGARCHS’, BUSINESS AND RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY:
FROM EL’TSIN TO PUTIN
Abstract:  The paper investigates the role of private and state-controlled business in the
formation and implementation of Russian foreign policy since the collapse of the
Soviet Union. The extent to which the ‘oligarchs’ and business more generally
followed their own interests in their external relations or acted as tools of the Russian
state is a particular focus. Under President Boris El’tsin, Boris Berezovskii was the
only one of the oligarchs to have significant influence on Russian foreign policy.
President Vladimir Putin’s moves against were the oligarchs motivated partly by the
desire to restrict political debate, including on foreign policy, and partly to prevent
Mikhail Khodorkovskii from creating a private oil pipeline system which would have
subverted Putin’s foreign policy, but the main reason was probably the desire to
restore state control over key industrial sectors. Under El’tsin, business had followed
its own interests, which sometimes conflicted with Russian foreign policy and
sometimes reinforced it; but after Putin’s attacks on the oligarchs, business seemed
more integrated into policy implementation, while still following its own interests
where they did not conflict with those of the state, as is suggested by a discussion of
Gazprom’s foreign policy role.

Title: THE SUSTAINABILITY OF RUSSIA’S ENERGY POWER: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE 
RUSSIAN ECONOMY
Abstract:  To what extent and through what mechanisms has Russian economic growth since1998 been 
dependent on Russia’s oil and gas industries? Is the likely development ofthese industries up to 2020 
capable of maintaining or increasing Russia’s role as anenergy supplier? What are the consequences for 
the rest of the Russian economy –that is, all production except oil and gas – of the leading role played 
by the hydrocarbons sector now and (probably) in the next decade or so?

Title: WHY ARE OPTIMISTIC ENTREPRENEURS SUCCESSFUL? AN APPLICATION OF 
THE REGULATORY FOCUS THEORY
Abstract:  Does entrepreneurial optimism affect business performance? Using a unique data set
based on repeated survey design, we investigate this relationship empirically. Our
measures of ‘optimism’ and ‘realism’ are derived from comparing the turnover
growth expectations of 133 owners-managers with the actual outcomes one year later.
Our results indicate that entrepreneurial optimists perform significantly better in terms
of profits than pessimists. Moreover, it is the optimist-realist combination that
performs best. We interpret our results using the regulatory focus theory.

Title: VOLUNTARY ENROLMENT IN THE PERUVIAN PRIVATE
PENSION SYSTEM
Abstract:  One of the important aspects in the design of social protection is coverage. In Peru, as
in most Latin American countries, social security participation is compulsory only for
workers in the ‘formal’ sector. We investigate the determinants of voluntary
enrolment in the private pension system in Peru. We found that a selected group of
people i.e. married males (with more than high school education) living in high
income households and with other family members already participating in the
pension system, have a higher likelihood of participation. Although the results
suggest that family based safety nets might be substitutes for pension participation,
pension coverage and poverty relief remain as challenges for government
involvement.

Title: Patterns of Industrial Upgrading in the Clothing Industry in Poland and Romania
Abstract:  This paper aims at understanding the impact of industrial networks with foreign and other
domestic organizations on industrial upgrading of the clothing companies in Poland and
Romania over the past decade. The research presented in this paper is based on
interviews carried out in ten large clothing companies in Poland and Romania. The paper
shows that there are differing structural influences of buyer-driven global networks on the
industrial upgrading of Polish and Romanian clothing firms. Taking these global buyers
as exemplars to themselves, Polish and Romanian clothing firms follow relatively
different upgrading patterns, experiencing more or less the same network relationships
with foreign buyers whereas differing networks with other organizations in their
countries. As the level of accumulation of knowledge and skills differs among the firms,
the pace and level of upgrading differs too. This paper has proposed a stylized pattern but
it should not be taken as inevitable since it also tries to show that some firms might skip
some sequences. As a consequence, it is not a question of the positioning of the countries
on a single upgrading ladder, but more accurately it is different upgrading ladders that
have been climbed in each country. There is no single pattern for all of them.

Title: Innovation strategies in central Europe: a corporate perspective
Abstract:  This paper seeks to outline the innovations strategies that various corporations have
pursued in Central Europe over the last few decades. It will examine from a corporate
perspective the scope and definition of innovation, highlighting how this has changed in
today’s eclectic ever changing environment. Drawing upon cases studies, this paper will
highlight best practice in formulating innovation strategies within Central Europe. In
conclusion, it will be argued that in spite of living in an environment where the pressure
for companies to constantly reinvent some part of themselves is increasing, companies
could greatly benefit from taking time to pause and consider how they can capitalise on
the key lessons and best practice considerations that have arisen.

Title: The Russian Triple Crisis 1998: Currency, Finance
and Budget
Abstract:  The paper analyzes the Russian currency crisis in August 1998. By critically discussing the
existing literature and by descriptively investigating data, the relative importance of economic
fundamentals, expectations, structural factors and external causes is assessed. The paper
highlights the contradicting requirements on the macroeconomic policy of a transition economy
that has a history of inflationary financing. The argument is that none of the previous analyzes
has highlighted clearly the triple crisis nature of the events: the crises in the currency and
financial markets were inseparably intertwined to the fiscal problems. However, in this emerging
market context the budget deficit cannot be stated to be the sole cause in the traditional sense of
the so-called first-generation currency crises theories.

Title: Integration of Poland into EU Global Industrial Networks: The Evidence and the Main 
Challenges
Abstract:  In this paper, we attempt to identify the achievements of one decade of transformation of
the Polish economy in effecting the integration of its manufacturing sector with those of
the broader European and global economy, using the automotive industry as an
illustrative example. We begin with a broad picture of the current situation in Poland,
looking particularly at the motivations of EU-based investors. We then discuss the
automobile industry, again examining the motives of foreign investors and the effects of
policy on their behavior. Next, we examine the chief public and private actors in the
integration process, with a particular focus on their roles in trying to push Poland’s
integration in the direction of high value added and high innovation. Finally, we briefly
discuss the impact of Poland’s accession to the EU on industrial networking, and then
summarize our conclusions and suggest a research framework for testing the hypothesis
(formulated on the basis of our observations of the Polish case) that the market
orientation of a given industry, measured by the ratio of the trade balance in that industry
to its total domestic output, depends among other things on ownership structure, with the
domestically-owned sector tending to use locally developed technologies and the foreignowned
sector tending to transfer in technology from abroad.

Title: “Integration of Slovenia into EU and Global Industrial Networks: Review of Existing Evidence
Abstract:  Slovenia is a small economy, which is somehow “condemned” to be open and highly
internationalised. Relatively high shares of exports and imports in GDP indicate that the economy
is highly dependent on foreign markets and inputs. This orientation is additionally strengthened
by the final stage of the transition process and accession to the EU, both meaning definite
opening of the economy and its integration into EU and global economy. Internationalisation of
operations is, therefore, increasingly becoming a critical factor for creating and stimulating a
competitive corporate sector in Slovenia. To strengthen the internationalisation processes, the
policy of internationalisation should be based on the following: (i) lifting barriers to
internationalisation; (ii) taking the actual needs of companies as a starting point; (iii) flexibility,
transparency and the long-term perspective; (iv) adaptability and a re-examination of policy; and
(v) a holistic concept of internationalisation. Increasingly important aspects of internationalisation
are inward and outward FDI. The paper review the existing evidence on the internationalisation
of Slovenian economy in all the various modes. The paper is composed of three parts. In the first
part the scale and dynamics of industry integration of Slovenia into EU/global industrial networks
by the way of foreign trade, outward and inward processing trade (OPT) and subcontracting and
FDI is given. The second part analyses the integration of Slovenian car components industry in
international industrial networks, and the third part concentrates on the motivation and strategies
of foreign investors in Slovenia and Slovenian investors abroad.

Title: FDI and Industrial Networks in Hungary
Abstract:  The paper summarises some of the key findings of research on the macro and
microeconomic effects of FDI, the impact of the MNCs on development, industrial and
trade restructuring, and presents a first attempt to draw a map of industrial networks in
Hungary. It answers the question whether the rapidly increasing presence of the MNCs
did, and will, increase the gap between indigenous and foreign-owned firms in Hungary,
or not; and whether the negative effects of a dual-type of economic development could be
revised or at least moderated by economic policy Some policy conclusions on the
competitive and strategic position of the interviewed firms and their "parents" are drawn
from the results.

Title: European Integration and Complementarities Driven Network Alignment: The Case of ABB in 
Central and Eastern Europe
Abstract:  The depth of industry integration between European ‘West’ and ‘East’ depends on the
simultaneous existence of several factors, which, through mutual complementarities,
align global and local networks. This paper takes the case of Asea Brown Bowery (ABB),
one of the first large investors in central and eastern Europe (CEE), to show that the
successful penetration of this company into CEE was the result of the simultaneous
occurrence of several factors, which had mutually reinforcing complementarities.
Changes in the strategy of ABB towards knowledge-based services may be weakening
these complementarities and dis-aligning local and global networks in CEE. By
integrating the insights of Milgrom and Roberts (1995) on complementarities the paper
further develops the ‘network alignment’ perspective (Kim and von Tunzelmann, 1998)
on growth.

Title: Consolidation of Ownership and Market Consolidation: The Role of Relational Investors on the 
Polish Beer Market 1990 –1999
Abstract: This paper presents a case study based on a full dataset related to 31 companies operating in 
the
Polish beer industry during the 1990’s. It discusses the impact of privatisation and of secondary
ownership transfers on market outcomes. It confirms the critical role played by foreign relational
investors in the process of industrial restructuring, and two parallel evolutions: a strong trend
towards concentrated ownership and towards market concentration. Companies, which were not
initially privatised to relational investors, were typically taken over by them in the later stage.
However, the delay led to a postponed restructuring process and a loss of market share.

Title: Performance after Mass Privatisation :The Case of Slovenia”
Marko Simoneti, Joze P. Damijan, Boris Majcen, Matija Rojec
Abstract:  Initial ownership structures resulting from the mass privatisation programme were intended 
as transitional,
whereas optimal would be set up gradually and would result from secondary transactions.
Therefore, mass privatisation is typically considered successful if secondary transactions lead to 
improved
ownership, in particular, with emergence of strategic investors. If this approach is correct, positive 
effects of
mass privatisation are thus not shown only by companies remaining in control of initial owners but 
mostly
by the companies that have already gone through secondary privatisation. Accordingly, the success of
secondary sales is to be evaluated by how successfully companies perform after the sale to new owners.
This paper attempts to verify empirically those assumptions. The econometric analysis of panel data, 
after
correcting for a selection bias, shows that TFP (total factor productivity) growth is highest in public
companies. In addition we found that the secondary privatisation has had practically no positive effect 
on
economic efficiency in the period 1995-99. We interpret these results as supporting evidence for the
theoretical approach, which argues that the impact of strategic investors on performance may be 
ambiguous
and that the quality of the capital market institutions is more important than ownership effects. The 
former
creates incentives for performance by increasing the cost of expropriation of minority shareholders.

Title: The emerging industrial architecture of the wider Europe: The co-evolution of industrial and 
political structures
Abstract:  Project results show that the international industrial networks in CEE are organized by
MNCs and are limited in scope (mainly intra-firm). The weakest node for further industry
upgrading via network alignment is a national network. There are big national differences in
network alignment across CEECs. These differences reflect differences in the strategies of
MNCs; the different roles of governments in different industries and countries; and the
different positions of local authorities. EU demand operates as a strong ‘focal point’
(attractor) for the emergence of new industry networks. EU demand generates the necessary
‘coherence’ for initial and still rudimentary local clustering organized by MNCs. Differences
in accession to the EU play a secondary role in market driven industrial networks. However,
in sectors where regulations are important (energy, telecoms, pharmaceuticals) network
alignment is strongly shaped by State regulations. The global political economy as well as EU
accession has shifted CEE states towards a regulatory role. Formal policy alignment with the
EU (deep policy integration) leaves unresolved the problem of conflicts and gaps in policy
implementation. This may have a significant effect on patterns of industry integration in
some sectors in the future. CEE states will have to learn how to influence industrial
development in their territory using structural assistance while at the same time complying
with the EU regulatory requirements.

Title: Corporate Governance and Industrial Relations in Poland
Abstract:  The paper discusses Polish privatisation from the industrial relations point of view. It
focuses on the role of trade unions and workers councils in the privatisation process.
Two polar privatisation blueprints are identified: those aiming at competitive ‘atomistic’
firms and those, which accentuate corporate financial-industrial structures and networks.
The internal structure of corporate control in Polish companies is evaluated from this
perspective, taking into account the role of organised labour, of the managers and of the
politicians in the privatisation process.

Title: Industries, Costs and Macroeconomic Regimes in Central and Eastern
European Countries : Towards Stylised Facts
Abstract:  Economists have difficulties to conceptualise and model the relationship between
macroeconomic policy and industry change. This paper explores the relationships
between industry cost structures and macroeconomic regimes in central and east
European countries (CEECs). It finds that the cost structures are more homogenous
within industries than within countries. Changes in cost structures are dominantly intraindustry,
i.e. unrelated to changes in industry structures though in some countries
structural and specialisation effects are also significant. The paper links the intensity of
changes in industry cost structures with a composite measure of macroeconomic stability.
In the case of five CEECs, it finds that there is a country-specific relationship between
changes in costs and macroeconomic stability. Based on these findings the paper provides
arguments for integration of macroeconomic and industrial (technology) policies.

Title: Short-run Lats Rate Movements: Impact of Foreign Currency Shocks via Trade and Financial 
Markets”
Abstract:  This paper investigates the short-run dynamic impact of foreign currency shocks on the
deviations of Latvian lats vis-à-vis US dollar market spot rate from the parity set via lats’ peg to
SDR for the period from 1994 to 2000. The analysis is based on the standard theoretical model of
dynamic cost adjustment, from which empirical models of the autoregressive distributed-lags
form are derived. Reduction of several versions of such general models leads to a number of
parsimonious and data congruent models. Our main findings from the modelling experiment are:
Cross-currency shocks produce extensive impact on the net rate of lats, especially those shocks
from the neighbouring transition economies, such as Estonia and Lithuania; These shocks may
not be original, and may well act as transmission ports of other foreign currency shocks; The
Russian crisis of August 1998 has exerted massive devaluation pressure on lats; The shocks are
found to be transmittable via either trade and financial linkages, with the financial channel being
the most contagious; Model configurations are found, however, neither unique nor definitely
invariant, suggesting that it might be necessary to maintain several models in practice to fulfil
different purposes in policy analyses and economic forecasting.

Title: Innovation Activities in Polish Industry in 1998-2000: Main Results from the GUS 2001 
Innovation Survey
Abstract:  The paper analyses results of GUS innovation survey in manufacturing for 1998-2000
and innovation survey in services for 1997-1999. Innovation activities in 1998-2000
reflect downturn in Polish economy of this period. A number of innovative enterprises
fell from 37.6 (1994-96) to 16.9 (1998-2000). Also, innovation expenditures, which
were continuously growing until 1999 have fallen for the first time. There is not
significant difference in number of innovative firms between manufacturing and services.
Innovation expenditures as percent of total turnover are still high when compared to the
EU but they have also fallen significantly from 1999 to 2000. Objectives of innovation
activities of Polish firms are similar as in the EU. Obstacles to innovation are also similar
except very high importance of interest rate as an obstacle to innovation in Poland. One
third of innovative firms cooperate in undertaking innovation activities but within this the
share of small firms is very small. A share of sales due to technologically new and
improved products has been continuously growing until 2000 when this share also
dropped.

Title: The Gender Wage Gap and Wage Arrears in Russia:
Evidence from the RLMS
Abstract:  Abstract: Using the RLMS, this paper re-examines the nature of the gender wage gap in 
Russia between
1994 and 1998 taking into account the pervasiveness of Russia’s non-payment institutions. 
Investigating
discrimination ‘bands’ at different sections of the income distribution and for various important sub-
groups
we found the following. Using censored regressions that capture the effect of wage arrears and payment 
inkind,
the wage gap is larger than estimates derived using OLS. The wage gap is distributed unevenly both
across the income distribution and between various sub-groups. Specifically, women at the lower end 
of the
income distribution suffer the highest degree of discrimination. However, we find that wage arrears and
payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, in particular amongst the lowest paid workers. The
evidence seems to suggest that Russian enterprise managers assigned importance to equity 
considerations
when allocating wage arrears and payment in-kind.

Title: Trade and Industrial Upgrading in Countries of Central and Eastern Europe: Patterns of Scale and 
Scope-based Learning
Abstract: The paper explores mechanisms that link trade and restructuring in countries of central and 
eastern
Europe through a learning and industrial upgrading perspective. A theoretical model based on notions 
of
scale (relative concentration in trade) and scope (changes in product variety) is introduced and applied,
based on detailed product level data for six central and east European countries (CEECs).
During the early transition period the dominant mode of learning was scope based learning
represented by a continuous increase in number of new products. In the later transition period, scope 
based
learning has been complemented by scale-based learning or increased concentration in exports with
significant country differences. Hungary is the only economy whose industrial upgrading has been
continuously based on a complementary increase in both the number of new products and increased
specialization.
An analysis, which is based on clusters of export products, shows the decreasing importance of
commodities (homogenous goods) and a shift towards technology and labour intensive products to be a
common trend. However, differences between central and east European countries are strong with 
respect
to changes in both scale and scope dimensions in technology and labour intensive activities. These
differences illustrate that trade based learning mechanisms - scale and scope - will have strong effects 
on
differences in industrial upgrading between central and east European economies.

Title: Corporate Governance and Stock Market Performance in Central
and Eastern Europe: A Study of nine countries, 1994-2001”
Abstract:  This paper offers analysis of corporate governance issues behind the stock market 
performance
(stock returns and activity) in nine Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries: the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Over
the period June 1994 – June 2001, on average the CEE stock markets have had lower returns and
higher risk than developed markets. This is explained by the negative influence of the two crisis
years (1995 and 1998), the “flight to quality” effect. Among other reasons, there are cases when
prices have been artificially kept down by the controlling owners in order to abuse the minority
shareholders. The evidence shows that the enforcement of law matters more than the quality of
law on the books, which is in line with previous research (Pistor et al, 2000). I find that the
effectiveness (enforcement) of financial regulations has the highest explanatory power of stock
market returns in the sample countries. The protection of minority shareholders (Legal index) has
a significant impact on market activity, measured by market turnover to market capitalization
ratio.

Title: The electronics industry in central and eastern Europe:
an emerging production location in the alignment of
networks perspective’
Abstract:  This paper analyses the emergence of central Europe as a new location for the production
of electronics. The main factors that drive integration in the region into global production
networks are also analysed, as well as prospects for upgrading the industry by using network
alignment perspectives.
Foreign investment is the primary vehicle of integration of CEE electronics firms into
global production networks, and Hungary has moved furthest along this path, positioning itself as
a major low-cost supply base in the region. Czech and Polish electronics industries are connected,
in smaller, but increasing, degrees to international electronics production networks. Networks that
are being built in CEE in electronics are usually confined to subsidiaries with still limited local
subcontracting; they are export-oriented and are expanding.
Local subsidiaries have mastered production capabilities and several subsidiaries in Hungary are
European mandate suppliers in their respective lines of business. EU demand is the main pull
factor, which gives cohesion to the actions of MNCs as well as to the action of local and national
governments in CEE. The layer of local firms is still very weak with very limited capabilities in
core technologies. This is the key weakness which prevents further alignment of networks in CEE
electronics. Local governments play an important role in working jointly with foreign investors in
establishing industrial parks and new capacities

Title: Industrial Integration and Growth of Firm in Transition Economies: The case of a French 
Multinational Company
Abstract: In the last decade, the prospect of accession of Central and East European countries (CEECs) 
to
the European Union has given momentum to the discussion of their economic integration into the
EU. Thus, academic studies have generally focused on variables at the macro level and are
conducted in the light of quantitative methodologies in social sciences. This paper instead focuses
mainly on the industrial integration of the CEECs into the EU at the firm and inter-organisational
level, and uses in-depth, face-to-face interview techniques. Examining the growth of a
multinational firm that operates in CEE in the context of networks help us to determine the depth
of east-west industrial networks. In this light, the aim of this paper is to contribute to the
development of the ‘network alignment’ framework from the perspective of the multinational
companies located and operating in CEE. The growth of the French Soufflet Group in CEECs is
taken as an exemplar to demonstrate the need to link the elements of the existing literature on
foreign direct investment (multinational companies) with an evolutionary approach, through
consideration of evolving and multiple networks.

Title: Inherited Labour Hoarding, Insiders and Employment Growth. Panel Data Results: Poland, 1996-
2002.
Abstract: Using panel data pertaining to large Polish (non-financial) firms this paper examines the
determinants of employment change during the period 1996-2002. Paying particular attention to
the asymmetry hypothesis we investigate the impact of own wages, outside wages, output
growth, regional characteristics and sectoral affiliation on the evolution of employment.
In keeping with the ‘right to manage’ model we find that employment dynamics are not affected
negatively by alternative wages.
Furthermore, in contrast to the early transition period, we find evidence that employment levels
respond to positive sales growth (in all but state firms). The early literature, (e.g. Kollo, 1998)
found that labour hoarding lowered employment elasticities in the presence of positive demand
shocks. Our findings suggest that inherited labour hoarding may no longer be a factor.
We argue that the present pattern of employment adjustment is better explained by the role of
insiders. This tentative conclusion is hinged on the contrasting behaviour of state and privatised
companies and the similar behaviour of privatised and new private companies. We conclude that
lower responsiveness of employment to both positive and negative changes in revenue in state

Title: Growth of Enterprises through Alliances in Central Europe
Abstract:  The paper explores the role of alliances in central European countries from the perspective of 
growth of enterprises.  The analysis is based on a comparative overview of 26 case studies of 
enterprises in Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary which have alliances with foreign partners.  Most 
of the alliances are production alliances, especially subcontracting, that are combined with several 
other types of alliances, especially marketing agreements.  The balance between generic expansion, 
alliances (networks), and mergers & acquisitions as modes of growth of enterprises reflects differences 
in firms' ability to control technology, access to market and finance.  However, the final outcome does 
not seem to be a direct function of the ability of enterprises to control these three factors.  The types 
and dynamics of alliances also reflect the political and legal situation of a country (privatisation, 
attitude towards FDI) as well as specific sectoral features in terms of technology, finance and markets.  
Features of alliances are in that context shaped through the interaction between form-specific factors 
and capabilities, sector-and country-specific factors.

enterprises with concentrated ownership are all less constrained in their access to
finance. Moreover, we identify alternative modes of finance since different corporate
control and past performance characteristics influence the sample firms’ choice of
finance source. In particular, while being industry-specific, the access to domestic credit
is positively associated with company size and past profitability. Industrial group
members tend to favour bond issues as well as sells-offs of assets as appropriate types
of finance for their investment programmes. Preferences for raising finance in the form
of equity are associated with share concentration in a non-monotonic way, being most
prevalent in those companies where the dominant owner holds 25-49% of shares. Close
links with a leading bank not only increase the possibility of bond issues but also appear
to facilitate access to non-banking sources of funds, in particular, to finance supplied by
industrial partners. Finally, reliance on state finance is less likely for the companies
whose profiles resemble the case of unconstrained finance, namely, for companies with
foreign partners, companies that are part of domestic industrial groups and companies
with a strategic investor. Model implications also include that the use of state funds is
less likely for Polish than for Hungarian companies.

Title: CORPORATE CONTROL AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES IN RUSSIA
Abstract:  In Russia, the problem of corporate governance has become a frequent subject for
discussion. Stories now abound about questionable corporate governance practices, such
as share dilution, asset stripping, transfer pricing, complex ownership structures, limiting
shareholders from attending the shareholders meetings. These practices, which have
come to constitute corporate governance abuses to company shareholders, are considered
to be factors adversely affecting the investment climate. At first glance, these nontransparent
practices are a collection of independent cases of managerial malfeasance that
are abusive to investors. However, there seems to be an internal logic in these widely
used practices, as they have been functional for Russian corporates to navigate through
circumstances characterised by an imperfect formal framework. The aim of this paper is
to analyse such functionalities of the practices in light of an evolution of corporate
Russia. Taking Yukos Oil Company as a case study, the paper demonstrates that resorting
to these practices was instrumental in a process of ensuring corporate survival and
strengthening market position by establishing a coherent corporate entity. This paper
emphasises that these practices represent rational and logical responses by economic
agents to the prevailing conditions shaped by policy choices, political and
macroeconomic environment, and institutions.

Title: Income Diversity in Rural Lithuania Benefits, Barriers, and Incentives
Abstract: Economic hardship, agricultural policy reform and price developments have adversely
affected incomes from agricultural production in Lithuania, and many farm households
have accessed additional sources of income in the rural economy. In an analysis of
recently collected survey data we find that non-farm wage employment particularly
benefits poorer household, whereas non-agricultural enterprises are more common
among higher-income farm households. Such enterprises diminish transaction problems
typical for transition economies, allow households to capture more value added than in
agricultural production, and create jobs in the local economy. Non-agricultural
enterprises are more likely to be found with larger households and in more remote areas.
Non-agricultural employment are more important income components for households
that have more dependant members, are located in remoter areas, and have less access to
economic institutions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of rural
income diversity in economic regeneration.

Title: A TWO-TIER OR MULTI-TIER EUROPE: ASSESSING THE INNOVATION CAPACITIES 
OF CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN
Abstract:  This paper assesses the innovation capacities of the central and east European (CEE)
candidate countries and the countries of the EU using a set of 25 indicators organized
within the national innovation capacity (NIC) framework. Based on regression and
cluster analysis the paper shows that NIC in the enlarged EU does not follow a simple
‘East – West’ divide. The wider Europe is structured into three groups of countries and
CEE countries are fall into two, the less developed and medium developed EU, groups.
NICs in the enlarged EU are assessed across four dimensions of capacity: absorptive,
R&D, diffusion and demand. In each of these dimensions we observe a two- or threetiering
of countries, which goes beyond a simple ‘East’ – ‘ West’ pattern. The results of
this assessment have important implications for candidate countries as well as for the EU
policy towards structural assistance.

Title: “Industrial Policy and European Integration: lessons from experience in Western Europe over
the last 25 years”
Abstract:  This paper seeks to draw together the work undertaken for the EU (Fourth Framework
Programme) TSER project on Science, Technology and Broad Industrial Policy with the
experience of the countries of East and Central Europe (CEECs) as it has been catalogued
through the papers written for this ESRC Programme on the Emerging Industrial Architecture
of the Wider Europe. The former project sought to explore developments in science,
technology and industrial/innovation policy in six Western European countries – France,
Germany, Italy, the UK, Sweden and Ireland – through the last 25 years of the 20th Century
and found a process both of integration (in the sense both of a growing together of economies
and a coming together of policies) but also of co-evolution, with national policies co-existing
with new strong strands of policy emerging at both EU and regional levels of government.

Title: Firms' Capabilities related to the Economic System: Cases from Ukraine and Russia
Abstract:  This paper suggests that certain capabilities of the firm are functional to the type of 
economic system (socialist, capitalist, transitional, etc.) in which the firm has to operate.  Their 
presence in a firm can be an important factor in explaining its ability to survive and develop.  It also 
suggests that concepts and definitions of the firm, offered by writers who have employed evolutionary 
and institutionalist models, yield useful perspectives on the processes of transition at the level of the 
individual enterprise.  Cases from Russia and Ukraine are used to investigate this conjecture and to 
identify those capabilities distinctive to a market economy, in contrast with those required by their 
previous economic system.  The capabilities, which have been conspicuously absent from the firms, 
which were relatively unsuccessful in adapting to the market economy, appear to relate particularly to 
management of purchasing, of innovation, of quality control, sales and trade credit.

Title: Ambiguity of Social Networks in Post-Communist Contexts
Abstract:  The paper discusses three hypotheses. First, it introduces four ideal types of networks which
are combined in the category of networks as used by social scientists. Four types result from
the intersection of two implicit choices made about networks – networks are assumed to be
either personal or impersonal, and are viewed either internally or externally. Thus, networks
are understood in terms of sociability, access to resources, enabling structure, or social capital.
Second, I argue that networks function in a fundamentally ambiguous way. They operate in
their capacity of a safety net or survival kit, provide a ‘beating the system’ capacity or
compensate for the system’s defects. At the same time networks provide constraints such as
high costs of informal contract, limits on individual action, lock-in effects and the handicaps
of social capital. Third, I illustrate differences between networks serving the economy of
favors in Russia and networks serving the purposes of ‘network society.’

Title:Privatisation, Corporate Control and Employment Growth:
Evidence From A Panel of Large Polish Firms, 1996-2002
Abstract:  Using panel data on large Polish firms this paper examines the relationship between 
corporate
control structures, sales growth and the determinants of employment change during the period 1996-
2002. We find that privatised and de novo firms are the main drivers of employment growth and
that, in the case of de novo firms, it is foreign ownership which underpins the result. Interestingly,
we find that being privatised has a positive impact on employment growth but that this impact is
concentrated within a range of three to six years after privatisation. In contrast with the findings of
earlier literature, we find evidence that there are no systematic differences in employment response
to negative sales growth across the ownership categories. On the other hand, employment in state
firms is less responsive to positive sales growth. From these combined results we infer that the
behaviour of state firms is constrained by both insider rent sharing and binding budget constraints.
Consistent with this, we find that privatised companies, three to six years post-privatisation, are the
firms for whom employment is most responsive to positive sales growth and as such, offer the best
hope for rapid labour market expansion.

Title: Wage Bargaining, Privatisation, Ability to Pay, and Outside Options – Evidence from Hungary
Abstract:  This paper examines the determinants of short-term wage dynamics, using a
sample of large Hungarian companies for the period of 1996-1999. We test the
basic implications of an efficient contract model of bargaining between the
incumbent employees and the managers, which we are unable to reject. In
particular, there are structural differences between the ownership sectors
consistent with our prior knowledge on relative bargaining strength and
unionisation measures. Stronger bargaining position of workers leads to higher
ability to pay elasticity of wages, and lower outside option elasticity. Our
results indicate that while bargaining position of workers in domestic
privatised firms may be weaker than in the state sector, the more robust
difference relate to state sector workers versus the privatised firms with the
majority foreign ownership.
We examine several extensions. We augment the bargaining specification by
controls related to workers’ skills and find that the basic findings are robust to
that. We take a closer look at the outside options of the workers. We find some
interactive effects, where unemployment modify the impact of availability of
rents on wages. We interpret our results as an indication that bargaining power
of workers may be affected by changes in their outside options. We also
experiment with one concise indicator of reservation wage which is closest to
the theoretical model specification and combines sectoral wages,
unemployment benefits and regional unemployment levels,. We found that
measure performing well.
Finally, we found that while responsiveness of wages towards ability to pay is
higher in the state sector, variation in wage dynamics is lower. This may
indicate some wage smoothing in the state sector, consistent with the
preferences of employees.

Title: Informal Practices in Changing Societies: Comparing Chinese Guanxi and Russian Blat
Abstract: The paper defines the key features of Chinese guanxi and Russian blat networks,
explores similarities and differences in the use of these networks both in communist
and post-communist economies, and discovers their ambiguous relationship with the
formal institutions. Having compared guanxixue and blat in detail, one should
conclude that people tend to develop similar responses (as well idioms) in order to
survive in state centralised economies characterized by shortages, state distribution
system and ideological predicaments. Guanxi and blat networks in pre-reform China
and Russia played a similarly ambiguous role in these economies: on the one hand,
they compensated for the defects of the formal rules thus enabling the declared
principles of the economy to exist; on the other hand, they subverted them. There are
also common trends in the transformation of informal practices in post-reform China
and Russia. Before the reforms, both guanxixue and blat were often beneficial to
ordinary people in allowing them to satisfy their personal needs and in organising
their own lives, whereas now their shift into corruption benefits the official-business
classes and hurts the bulk of society. Trust and social networks are vital components
of both economies and will continue to exist (as elsewhere) but their implications for
the transformation may differ. The post-Soviet reforms have changed the Soviet-type
blat practices so much that blat has almost ceased to be a relevant term for the use of
personal networks both in the state and in the new sectors of the economy. Being
more culturally and historically grounded, the term guanxi has sustained and found its
new use in contemporary China. There is much more discussion of guanxi and guanxi
capitalism in China than ever has been on blat in Russia. The partiality of reforms in
China and the communist rulership does not prevent foreign investment and economic
success, and corruption is estimated as not as damaging in China as it is in Russia.

Title: The Estonian Organizations – The Subjects of Transformation
Abstract: Estonia stayed fifty years under the communist regime. Historically the organizations in the
former Soviet Union were carefully controlled by the state and served as the tools of controlling
individuals and groups. Estonia’s transition to a democratic society provides an intriguing context
for analyzing how organizations have changed. The goal of this paper is to show what kind of
changes took place in Estonian organizations in the framework of transition of the Estonian
society. The changes are discussed from the perspective of four organizational elements: people,
organizational goal, structure, and technology. This is an exploratory study, which enables
detecting several aspects of the business and public sector organizations, whereas the major focus
is on human behavior rather than on economic aspects of organizational life.

Title: Revisiting Consumption Smoothing and the 1998 Russian Crisis
Abstract:  Applying quantile regression techniques to Russian data we investigate the channels through
which individuals experience changes in their well being. We find that married individuals in
non-rural households with university-educated heads are less vulnerable to severe welfare
shocks. For the most vulnerable individuals the labour market plays a key role in transmitting the
effects of aggregate shocks through the unemployment channel whereas those individuals able to
maintain their employment status are more able to cope with economic shocks. While increases
in pension payments help individuals to cope with shocks, it transpires that vulnerable
individuals rely more broadly on the support of relatives and the produce of their garden plots
and dachas.

Title: Insurance Company Financial Management by Optimising Premium Level: the case of Poland.
Abstract:  The article, which falls within the terms of reference of insurance risk analysis, presents
research on the death risk regional differentiation and its influence on the level of insurance
and social security premiums.
The article is divided into four parts. The first one describes probability of death as a
measure of calculated death risk and presents synthetic results of death probability estimates
for individual Polish voivodships. In the second part net life insurance premiums calculated
separately for individual voivodships and premiums calculated with the average death risk
factor for the entire territory of Poland are compared. Part three discusses the effect of the
regional premium and death risk differentiation method on financial management of
insurance companies indicating the value of the insurance fund established. The said fund has
been calculated on the basis of the method presented and without the application of the
regional premium differentiation method. In conclusion, recommendations are made
concerning the possible application of the regional premium differentiation by insurance
companies.

Title: Autonomy and Capacity:
A state-centred approach to Post-communist transition in central Europe
Abstract:  The paper examines state characteristics and their policy implications in five Central
European post-communist countries. It argues that policies on macroeconomic
stabilisation, privatisation and FDI had been shaped by state-society relations, which,
in turn, had been affected by policy outcomes. Curiously, though, whereas structural
and institutional developments exhibited a great deal of path-dependency in some
countries, in others significant policy shifts took place. The conceptual tools of state
capacity and autonomy are used to describe both dynamics, as well as to explain the
spectacular variation in the role of FDI across the region.

Title: De-industrialisation and the Post-Communist Transition: Rowthorn and Wells’ Model Revisited
Abstract:  16 September 2005
In this paper we present a simple three-sector model explaining the structural change
in employment, which is a modified version of Rowthorn-Wells (1987). We
supplement the theoretical analysis with simple econometric tests, which illustrate
how the modified Rowthorn-Wells model can be used to (i) motivate empirical
estimates of the link between the level of development and structures of employment,
(ii) illustrate structural distortions under the command economies, and the structural
adjustment that happened during the post-Communist transition. We demonstrate that
in the case of these economies, the transition process leads to an adjustment to the
employment structures predicted by the model.

Title: Upgrading Russian Enterproses from the value chain perpective: The Case Study of Tube & Pipe, 
and Furniture Sectors
Abstract: The paper is the first analysis of the competitiveness of Russian enterprises from the 
perspective of value
chains, with a focus on the example of tube & pipe and furniture producers.  In both industries, Russian 
firms
enjoy an advantage on raw material side.  Nevertheless, the overall competitiveness level of Russian 
producers remains
modest.  Domestic industries primarily owe decreased competitiveness to the inadequate operation of 
the final links in the  
value chain:
from end-product production to end-product user.  In addition, the competitiveness of domestic 
producers is limited to the 
ability of key players in the chain to redistribute additional gains in their own favour. Study shows that 
any non-selective 
of supporting enterprises (such as tax reductions) exert extremely limited influence on the status of 
players in those chains
where one of the links is characterized by the serious entry barriers and related opportunities of rent 
redistribution in 
favour of a particular player.  Paper suggests several policy measures which aim to improve the ability 
of the producers
to reposition themselves along the chain and modify the chain itself

Title: The Promotion of Innovation in Slovenia through Knowledge Transfer from Higher Education 
Institutions to SME's
Abstract:  This paper provides an audit of Slovenian initiatives for promoting innovation in small and 
medium-sized  
enterprises (SME's) 
through knowledge transfer from Higher Education Institutions (HEI's).  The first two sections set out a 
brief review
of knowledge transfer and innovation performance in Slovenia, which shows that the country has 
managed to sustain a  
relatively
high level of public expenditure on research and development.  Slovenia has a relatively high 
proportion of employees and 
value-added in high technology manufacturing compared to the EU average.  However, innovation 
among SME's is relatively low 
compared to the average of EU member states. The next two sections review the research literature on 
knowledge transfer from 
HEI's to SME's, and describe the Slovenian government's innovation policy framework and the 
extensive programme to promote
knowledge transfer from HEI's to the business sector.  The penultimate section presents an audit of 
knowledge transfer  
policies in Slovenia, which covers policies towards SME incubators, technology parks, technology 
centres, technology  
networks, industrial clusters, financial subsidies for high-technology SME's, and the mobility 
programme for young  
researchers.  The audit is based on documentary evidence and interviews carried out in April 2005, and 
presents case studies  
of an innovative university-based incubator and a successful industrial in the automotive industry.
The paper concludes that although some of the measures have achieved a degree of success there are 
two key problems.
The first problem is that knowledge transfer policies are weakened by the strong demarcation between 
pure and applied  
research in the HEI sector.  Thus, although there us a degree of knowledge transfer from research 
institutes, there is little 
knowledge transfer from universities to the business sector.  Universities mainly pursue pure research 
and there are a few  
incentives for academics to commercialize their scientific activities.  The second problem is that the 
knowledge transfer  
activities that do take place between the research institutes and businesses largely by-pass the SME 
sector, and are mainly  
geared towards large companies. Consequently, SMEs fail to benefit from the governments extensive 
programme to support  
innovation and knowledge transfer.  It is not surprising therefore that Slovenia's SMEs have a relatively 
weak innovation  
performance.  The final section sets out a set of policy recommendations which we believe are 
necessary to redress this  
imbalance and to improve the practice of knowledge transfer from HEIs to SMEs in Slovenia.

Title: Reconstitution of Post-Soviet Ex-State Enterprises into Russian Business Firms Under 
Institutional Weaknesses
Abstract:  The paper provides an interpretation of the transformation of post-soviet Russian enterprises 
from the  
resource-based perspective of the firm in the context of institutional change.  Based on the resource-
based perspective,  
which conceptualises a firm as a collection of resources embedded in business functions that are 
organised within an  
administrative framework, this paper demonstrate that the restructuring of post soviet enterprises 
entailed their  
reorganisation or reconstitution into business units, able to engage in commercial activities and 
compete in a market  
orientated environment.  Building on the resource-based interpretation of the firm in the post-socialist 
context, and  
focusing on the institutional environment in which firms operate, the paper analyses the role of 
informal business practices  
in Russia - particularly in the area of corporate governance - form the reconstitution of post-soviet 
enterprises into  
business units.  Taking the case of Yukos Oil Company in the 1990s, it argues that considering 
informal practices in the  
context of fulfilling tasks of corporate reconstitution points to their functionality in the face of 
disintegration of the  
Soviet economic system and institutional weaknesses.

Title: Post-Communist Recessions Re-examined
Abstract:  We apply simple econometric methods to evaluate the factors that determined the
length and depth of the post-Communist recessions. Early implementation of the
stabilisation and liberalisation programmes made the recessions weaker. Wars had
strong negative impact. Initial trade dependence made recessions more serious. The
results are discussed with reference to the existing explanations of the ‘transitional
recessions’, in particular Calvo and Coricelli (1992, 1993), Blanchard and Kremer
(1997) and Blanchard (1997).

Title: Foreign Direct Investment and Restructuring in the Automotive Industry in Central and East 
Europe
Abstract:  This paper reviews and explores the major effects of the FDI on industry restructuring of the 
CEE automotive industry.  In particular, we are interested if automotive companies have exploited the 
value creation potential of CEE?  Which factors explain the scale and depth of automotive industry 
restructuring in CEE? What are the economic effects of restructuring the automotive industry in terms 
of employment, trade and technology? What has been the role of national and EU policies in shaping 
the FDI and restructuring in the CEE automotive industry? 
	Our results suggest that the value creation potential of CEE as a global automotive location 
has not yet been fully exploited with great differences across countries.  A combination of country 
specific factors (proximity to EU markets, socialist heritage in automotive industry, skilled labour and 
privatisation policies) couple with strategies of automotive MNCs have generated different country 
patterns and very different effects on industry.  Improvements in productivity and technology transfer 
in both embodied (equipment upgrading) and disembodied form (know how) are significant in 
countries with large FDI in automotive industry.  Employment effects are positive in particular in 
automotive suppliers industry.  Privatisation policy in early 1990s which was followed by a policy of 
attracting Greenfield FDI on the eve of the EU accession is crucial in explaining country differences in 
FDI PRESENCE.  Automotive investors have foreseen EU accession and in that respect, EU 
membership will not bring to changes in trend but possibly a deepening of the automotive cluster in 
central Europe.  However, whether this will happen or not will depend on the ability of CEECs to 
develop sector specific policies which would support the upgrading of local automotive suppliers.

Title: Financial Performance of Groups of Companies in Poland against the background of historical 
determinants and knowledge management procedures applied
Abstract: Polish businesses are passing the fifteen year mark of the free market experience.  The 
important processes that could be observed during that time include the formation of the groups of 
companies.  What were the establishment paths of these multiple organisations and what was the 
impact of historical determinants on their operation and financial performance?  What is the extent on 
contribution of subsidiaries to the financial performance of the groups? And finally what are the main 
drivers of their effectiveness in the context of group management system applied and knowledge 
management procedures?
This paper attempts to provide answers to these questions.  It presents insights, observations and 
selected findings of research conducted over the period of the last five years.  Its is shown that the 
operation of these organisations is on the one hand strongly determined by historical factors, and on the 
other the strength of this impact diminishes with time. Groups of companies see positive operational 
changes, reflected mainly in improved financial performance, growing significance of subsidiaries and 
the enhanced effectiveness of the management systems applied which are broadly based on knowledge 
management procedures.

Title: Are the EU New Member States Fiscally Sustainable? An Empirical Analysis
Abstract:  This paper discusses the theoretical aspects of fiscal sustainability and identities the
main sources of fiscal non-sustainability from the perspective of both general equilibrium models
and partial equilibrium models. The study adopts the partial equilibrium approach to investigate
empirically whether the EU New Member States are fiscally sustainable. The stationarity test
and cointegration analysis are employed to examine this issue. According to the debt stationarity
tests, countries such as Lithuania and Slovenia are the only ones that can be regarded as fiscally
sustainable. According to a cointegration analysis of government revenues and expenditures none of
the analysed countries is fiscally sustainable. However, analyses based on public debt stationarity
test and intertemporal budget constraint do not account for the costs associated with the transition
period, therefore the final conclusion of no sustainability in NMS should be put into a broader
context of transformation from a centrally planned economy to a market oriented system. This, of
course, should not be taken as an excuse for failing to pursue prudent fiscal policy aiming to ensure
sustainability over the long-term. The policy implication of this is that the vast majority of the
EU New Member States have to undertake significant corrective measures to ensure sustainability
over the long-term: certainly more than is being done at the present time.

Title: Growth Expectations of Business Owners Impact of Human Capital, Firm Characteristics and 
Environmental Transition
Abstract:  This paper presents an empirical study based on a survey of 399 owners of small and 
medium
size companies in Lithuania. Applying bivariate and ordered probit estimators, we investigate
why some business owners expect their firms to expand, while others do not. Our main
findings provide evidence that SME owner’s generic and specific human capital matter.
Those with higher education and ‘learning by doing’ attributes, either through previous job
experience or additional entrepreneurial experience, expect their businesses to expand. The
expectations of growth are positively related to exporting and non-monotonically to enterprise
size. In addition, we analyse the link between the perceptions of constraints to business
activities and growth expectations and find that the factors, which are perceived as main
business barriers, are not necessary those which are associated with reduced growth
expectations. In particular, perceptions of both corruption and of inadequate tax systems seem
to affect growth expectations the most.

Title: GROWTH, INTEGRATION AND SPILLOVERS IN THE CENTRAL AND EAST 
EUROPEAN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY
Abstract:  This paper explores growth and competitive advantage in CEE software firms; it looks at the
role of strategic partnerships and industry (spillover) effects. The empirical analysis is based
on survey data from 224 software firms from six CEE countries (Bulgaria, Czech R, Estonia,
Serbia, Slovenia, Romania). The results of the descriptive analysis are interpreted from the
perspective of the role of capabilities in industrial development. The analysis shows that the
patterns of growth are a mix of sector, region and sub--region specific determinants and show
important national differences. This suggests that the CEE software industry cannot be
considered as a homogenous phenomenon. There is no general tendency towards an
expansion in exports; based on our sample only Romania is developing an export oriented
software industry.
Research shows that the CEE software industry is populated by young, dedicated, domestic
firms, which are independent, and privately owned and which are mainly oriented towards
localisation of software. They are strongly dependent for trade and production on alliances
and strategic partnerships with foreign partners and a small share of technology based
partnerships. There is an extensive process of industry upgrading underway, involving
country and sub-region specific changes. The spillover effects are significant, through links
with clients and intensive intra-industry knowledge transfer through high employment
turnover and potentially high knowledge transfer from foreign to local projects. Differences
between central and eastern Europe are strong in terms of degree of diversification of
software supply, industrial upgrading and quality of demand.
The pattern of software development in CEE differs from that in other emerging markets in
the sense that it is domestic market oriented, but with an emerging export market for services.
Its further growth and upgrading will be strongly dependent on the acquisition of
organisational capabilities by local firms.

Title: NATURE AND DETERMINANTS OF PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH OF FOREIGN 
SUBSIDIARIES IN CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
Abstract: The paper examines the determinants of productivity growth in foreign manufacturing
subsidiaries in five Central and East European (CEE) countries by analysing patterns of
control, nature of firms’ capabilities and firms’ market orientation. Building on the so
called ‘developmental subsidiaries’ perspective we show that productivity growth is
determined jointly by corporate governance, production capability and market orientation
variables. CEE subsidiaries have relatively strong autonomy over control of their
business functions, but within a dominantly production oriented mandate. Majority
foreign equity share has a significant and positive impact on subsidiaries’ productivity
growth. These results present very strong regional characteristic.

Title: BETWEEN VISION AND REALITY: PROMOTING INNOVATION THROUGH 
TECHNOPARKS IN KAZAKHSTAN
Abstract: A common motivation for the technopark movement is the belief that technoparks promote
innovation and economic growth at regional and/or national levels. The paper analyses the
role of technoparks as instruments of innovation promotion in Kazakhstan using data from a
firm survey and interviews. Our results suggest that, unlike what is assumed in the innovation
policy literature, technoparks do not house firms dealing with the commercialisation of
innovations that are ready for introduction to the market. Technopark firms are no more
innovative than other firms. They are oriented largely towards the local market, and operate in
traditional sectors; the frequency and intensity of their external links are more developed than
are their internal links. The key motivations for relocating to a technopark seem to be lower
rents and the possibility of accessing finance. Overall, Kazakh technoparks seem to be
successful in terms of facilitating business incubation, but much les so in terms of innovation
promotion and diversification of the economy. Currently, Kazakh industry does not make any
demands for local R&D, and its sources of competitiveness lie in non-R&D activities. This
suggests that innovation policy should focus on assisting companies to upgrade their
technological capabilities to the level that they can articulate their R&D demands. Focusing
on technoparks as the main mechanism to improve competitiveness and diversify the
economy is an ineffective and uncertain a policy option at this stage of the country’s
economic development. However, there seems to be significant scope for supporting business
incubation. These conclusions are of relevance to other emerging economies.

Title: FISCAL TRANSPARENCY AND POLICY RULES IN POLAND
Abstract: This paper assesses the current stance and desirable progress in the implementation of
fiscal transparency and rules in Poland. An index of transparency based on Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), with some modifications, is also
constructed in this paper, followed by proposals for making transparency and fiscal rules
more efficient within Poland’s fiscal policy. This study attempts to answer the following questions: Firstly, to what extent is fiscal policy transparent in the context of the
standards set by the EU’s regulations and the IMF’s ROSC? Secondly, have the fiscal
rules adopted by Poland proved to be successful in establishing fiscal policy discipline?
Finally, what still needs to be changed to make both transparency and fiscal rules more
efficient for the conduct of fiscal policy? To set the work in context we also provide an
overview of recent advances in both the theoretical and empirical literature on fiscal
transparency and rules.

Title: Construction of Home by Polish and Lithuanian Migrants in the UK
Abstract: Researchers across the social sciences and humanities have sought to understand the nature of 
people’s
affiliation with a particular place, to understand the emotional and symbolic ties that bind people to a
place and make them feel at home. The concept of home becomes especially complex when analysed
in the light of migration. In this context Gilles Deleuza and Felix Guattari (1987) invent a pair of concepts: ‘homing of diaspora’ and ‘diasporising of home’. These two phrases express the essence of
diasporic existence: on one hand, ‘home’ and especially nostalgia for home left behind is infused into
the very notion of diaspora; on the other hand, diasporas take their ‘home’ with them when they travel
and reconstruct ‘home’ in the new environment. This article analyses how these processes of home
creation take place among the new Polish and Lithuanian migrants in the UK, based on interviews
conducted with migrant workers for the research project ‘Changing Status, Changing Lives?’ carried
out by the University of Oxford.

Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the relationship between changes in the
ownership structure and the development of life insurance companies in Poland. The simple
regression model is used to reveal the relation. The findings of this study, that the solvency
ratio, overall indebtedness ratio, premiums retention ratio and profitability ratio on technical
activity and sales are positively related with the changes in the share of foreign capital and
especially that the claims ratio is negatively related, suggest that foreign investments have
greatly influenced the development of the life insurance industry in Poland during the
transition period.

Title: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, MANAGERS’ INDEPENDENCE, EXPORTING AND 
PERFORMANCE OF FIRMS IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES
Abstract: Using data on 157 large companies in Poland and Hungary this paper employs Bayesian
structural equation modeling to examine interrelationships between corporate
governance, managers’ independence from owners in terms of strategic decision-making,
exporting and performance. It is found that managers’ independence is positively
associated with firms’ financial performance and exporting. In turn, the extent of
managers’ independence is contingent on the firm’s corporate governance parameters: it
is negatively associated with ownership concentration, but positively associated with the
percentage of foreign directors on the firm’s board. We interpret these results as an
indication that (i) risk averse, concentrated owners tend to constrain managerial
autonomy at the cost of the firm’s internationalization and performance, (ii) board
participation of foreign stakeholders, on the other hand, enhances the firm’s export
orientation and performance by encouraging executives’ decision-making autonomy.

Title:  Entrepreneurship in Transition Countries: A Review
Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the key issues surrounding 
entrepreneurship
development in transition countries focusing on six main themes. Though it can be argued that the
transition countries started from more or less the same point when they embarked on their
transitional path, in this paper, we indicate a number of the differences in initial conditions which
further influenced SME development. By surveying the existing literature on SME development,
this paper illustrates that as the transition process progresses, entrepreneurship development in
transition countries is a story of increasing divergence. The transitional context provides
unique opportunities for entrepreneurship activities to develop. However, at the same
time this environment presents unique challenges for entrepreneurial development
especially knowledge-based entrepreneurship as the free-market system matures within a
context with low levels of SMEs and inherited negative views towards entrepreneurship.

Title: New Estimates of the Risk and Duration of Registered Unemployment in Urban Russia
Abstract: This paper examines whether deregistration from the employment office decreases
unemployment duration. The study is based on Russian individual-level data from the
Public Employment Office of Rostov-on-Don combined with information from the
2000 household survey. Using a proportional hazard model, I find a significant excess
in job finding rates following employment office deregistration. The predicted risk of
getting a job is non-monotonic and tends to decrease at longer duration intervals. An
important finding is that only 29% of the unemployed obtained a job simultaneously
with deregistering from the Public Employment Office. Others continued to search for
job on their own.

Title:  Institutions, Infrastructure, and Trade
Abstract:  We examine the influence of infrastructure, institutional quality, colonial and geographic 
context, and trade
preferences on the pattern of bilateral trade. We are interested in threshold effects, and so emphasize 
those cases
where bilateral country pairs do not actually trade. We depart from the institutions and infrastructure 
literature in
this respect, using selection-based gravity modeling of trade flows. We also depart from this literature 
by mixing
principal components (to condense our institutional and infrastructure measures) with a focus on 
deviations in the
resulting indexes from expected values for given income cohorts to control for multicollinearity. We 
work with a
panel of 284,049 bilateral trade flows from 1988 to 2002. Matching bilateral trade and tariff data and 
controlling
for tariff preferences, level of development, and standard distance measures, we find that infrastructure, 
and
institutional quality, are significant determinants not only of export levels, but also of the likelihood 
exports will
take place at all. Our results support the notion that export performance, and the propensity to take part 
in the
trading system at all, depends on institutional quality and access to well developed transport and 
communications
infrastructure. Indeed, this dependence is far more important, empirically, than variations in tariffs in 
explaining
sample variations in North-South trade.

Title:  The Great Divide: “Ruralisation” of Poverty in Russia
Abstract:  Using data from the RLMS for the period 2000-2004 we investigate poverty trends in
Russia. We find that urban poverty declines at twice the rate of rural poverty so that by
2004 poverty in Russia had become a largely rural phenomenon for the first time since
transition began. This finding does not stem from changing population characteristics or
shares, is not dependent on the use of a particular poverty line nor is it driven by the rapid
expansions that have occurred in Moscow, St. Petersburg or other urban areas. Our
findings flesh out those of Ravallion et al (2007) who, in contrast to other regions, “find
signs” of a ruralisation of poverty in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. We
attribute some of the differential to the labour market.

Title: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITIVENESS IN SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE: ASSET OR LIABILITY FOR EU INTEGRATION? 
Abstract:  This paper explores the relationship between research and development (R&D) and
competitiveness of the SEE economies from the perspective of the EU integration and the
EU as a knowledge based economy. Specifically, paper addresses the question of
whether SEE is a potential asset or a liability in this process.
SEE countries are quite diverse in terms of levels of competitiveness, with visible effects
on the role of R&D which is confirmed by analysis of the demand and supply factors of
R&D. Although tentative, results show that innovation policy that takes account of the
supply and demand side factors of R&D is essential to knowledge based growth in the
SEE economies. This poses some limits to traditionally defined S&T policy as a sectoral
activity and calls for new approaches, which are discussed in the paper.

Title: Inequality, Democracy and Taxation: Lessons from the Post-Communist Transition
Abstract:  Using data for post-communist economies (1989-2002), we examine the determinants of 
income inequality. We
find a strong positive association between equality and tax collection but note that this relationship is 
significantly
stronger under authoritarian regimes than under democracies. We also discover that early 
macroeconomic
stabilisation resulted in lower inequality; we confirm that education fosters equality and find that larger 
countries
are prone to higher levels of inequality.

Title: National Systems of Innovation and Entrepreneurship: In Search of a Missing Link
Abstract:  The literature on national systems of innovation (NIS) has neglected the issue of
entrepreneurship because of several incompatibilities between the two notions.
The Schumpeterian legacy, the current person-centric view of entrepreneurship,
and methodological problems related to treating entrepreneurship at the macrolevel,
have made it difficult to integrate entrepreneurship into the NIS perspective.
At national level it is more appropriate to treat entrepreneurship as a ‘property’
(dimension) of NIS. In order to link NIS and entrepreneurship we must establish a common conceptual
basis. Our argument is that the functional view of NIS and entrepreneurship
presents a common basis for such an approach. We develop criteria for the
entrepreneurial NIS which we define as being those that can change balance
between individual and cooperative entrepreneurship; that enhance both the
opportunity and skill aspects of entrepreneurship; and that can balance generation
of uncertainty with support to business models and other organisations which pool
uncertainty. From the NIS perspective, we explain entrepreneurship as a systemic phenomenon
driven by complementarities between technological, market and institutional
opportunities. This framework builds on three research traditions in the
entrepreneurship/NIS literature (Schumpeterian, Kirznerian and Listian) which
jointly form a multi-level, multi-dimensional framework for understanding
entrepreneurship from a NIS perspective. This framework could be useful as a
heuristic for empirical research on entrepreneurship. Finally, we analyse policies
for entrepreneurship and find that they are highly dependent on underlying and
previously discussed conceptions of entrepreneurship.

Title: Convergence across Russian Regions: A Spatial Econometrics Approach
Abstract:  This paper analyses the process of convergence across the regions of Russia using spatial
econometrics tools in addition to the traditional ß-convergence techniques as derived from the
neoclassical theoretical setting. The spatial component appears to be non-negligible and,
consequently, conventional convergence estimates suffer a bias due to spatial dependence across
observations. Furthermore, variables such as hydrocarbon supply, openness to trade and FDI per
capita are found to have an unambiguous, positive and statistically significant impact on growth
(Results are also confirmed by the panel counterpart of the model. Estimates for this last are presented 
in Appendix E

Title: Knowledge Based Entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary: Results from 4 case studies.
Abstract:  This paper describes knowledge based entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary, in particular the growth and development process of 4 firms are studied:
Dekonta, an environmental services firm, Et netera, an IT services firm, both
operating in Czech Republic, along with a data recovery firm, Kurt, and a
biopharmaceutical firm, Solvo, both operating in Hungary. The objectives of the case
studies are to illustrate experiences of knowledge based entrepreneurship within a
transition environment in terms of their different growth and development paths.
By carrying out in depth case studies using semi structured interviews with the
founders, top management teams, core employees and key stakeholders in industrial
associations I am able to explain the growth process of entrepreneurial knowledge
based ventures. I assume an ecological view of the firm and examine the role of
internal, strategic, network and external factors in this development process. I propose
that the relative importance of these factors evolve over time from start up to
maturity. Moreover, I anticipate that there will be complementarities between these
factors in the spirit of Milgrom and Roberts (1995) and Von Tunzelmann (2003).  This approach 
should help us better understand the complex nature of
entrepreneurship. The key contributions of these case studies are the application of an ecological
conceptual framework to the development of knowledge based firms in Central and
Eastern Europe, and so the viability of this model is tested within the transition
environment. I follow the recommendations by Ireland et al. (2005) and introduce a
temporal element in order to analyse the shift in importance of the factors impacting
on firm development and growth, thus hoping to deal with some of the criticisms on
existing entrepreneurial research.

Title: Do Institutions Matter for Technological Change in
Transition Economies?  The Case of Russia’s 89 regions and republics.
Abstract:  We explore the impact of institutions on technological change in a transition
economy. We use regional panel data for Russia’s 89 regions and republics during the
period of recovery and growth from 1998 to 2004 to show the impact of large
variation in institutional development, ranging from full enforcement of property
rights in the Northwest to red belt Communist regimes in the southeast. We find an
unambiguous relationship between strong and sustained institutional development and
technological change. We provide one model proxying the quality of institutions by
the investment risk rating compiled by the rating agency ExpertRA Regions. (JEL:

Title:Utility payments in Ukraine: affordability, subsidies and arrears 
Abstract:Transition has led to a significant increase in the severity and incidence of poverty in Eastern Europe.
One important aspect of poverty is access to, and the affordability of, basic services like electricity,heat and water. This paper provides evidence on this issue from the Ukraine Longitudinal Monitoring
Survey (ULMS). The paper identifies considerable differences in both access and affordability between different localities in Ukraine. Social protection measures can help to alleviate affordability
constraints, but the analysis finds that social support is not well targeted. The currently low tariffs prevent an escalation of affordability problems but constraints nevertheless exist. Many households
have accumulated substantial arrears as a consequence, although non-payment is a complex issue and not solely a function of affordability.
