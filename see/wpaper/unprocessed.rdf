Title: Privatisation, corporate control and employment growth: evidence from a panel of large Polish firms, 1996-2002
Abstract: Using panel data on large Polish firms this paper examines the relationship between corporate control structures, sales growth and the determinants of employment change during the period 1996-2002. We find that privatised and de novo firms are the main drivers of employment growth and that, in the case of de novo firms, it is foreign ownership which underpins the result. Interestingly, we find that being privatised has a positive impact on employment growth but that this impact is concentrated within a range of three to six years after privatisation. In contrast with the findings of earlier literature, we find evidence that there are no systematic differences in employment response to negative sales growth across the ownership categories. On the other hand, employment in state firms is less responsive to positive sales growth. From these combined results we infer that the behaviour of state firms is constrained by both insider rent sharing and binding budget constraints. Consistent with this, we find that privatised companies, three to six years post-privatisation, are the firms for whom employment is most responsive to positive sales growth and as such, offer the best hope for rapid labour market expansion.

Title: Wage Bargaining, Privatisation, Ability to Pay, and Outside Options – Evidence from Hungary
Abstract:  This paper examines the determinants of short-term wage dynamics, using a
sample of large Hungarian companies for the period of 1996-1999. We test the
basic implications of an efficient contract model of bargaining between the
incumbent employees and the managers, which we are unable to reject. In
particular, there are structural differences between the ownership sectors
consistent with our prior knowledge on relative bargaining strength and
unionisation measures. Stronger bargaining position of workers leads to higher
ability to pay elasticity of wages, and lower outside option elasticity. Our
results indicate that while bargaining position of workers in domestic
privatised firms may be weaker than in the state sector, the more robust
difference relate to state sector workers versus the privatised firms with the
majority foreign ownership.
We examine several extensions. We augment the bargaining specification by
controls related to workers’ skills and find that the basic findings are robust to
that. We take a closer look at the outside options of the workers. We find some
interactive effects, where unemployment modify the impact of availability of
rents on wages. We interpret our results as an indication that bargaining power
of workers may be affected by changes in their outside options. We also
experiment with one concise indicator of reservation wage which is closest to
the theoretical model specification and combines sectoral wages,
unemployment benefits and regional unemployment levels,. We found that
measure performing well.
Finally, we found that while responsiveness of wages towards ability to pay is
higher in the state sector, variation in wage dynamics is lower. This may
indicate some wage smoothing in the state sector, consistent with the
preferences of employees.

Title: Informal Practices in Changing Societies: Comparing Chinese Guanxi and Russian Blat
Abstract: The paper defines the key features of Chinese guanxi and Russian blat networks,
explores similarities and differences in the use of these networks both in communist
and post-communist economies, and discovers their ambiguous relationship with the
formal institutions. Having compared guanxixue and blat in detail, one should
conclude that people tend to develop similar responses (as well idioms) in order to
survive in state centralised economies characterized by shortages, state distribution
system and ideological predicaments. Guanxi and blat networks in pre-reform China
and Russia played a similarly ambiguous role in these economies: on the one hand,
they compensated for the defects of the formal rules thus enabling the declared
principles of the economy to exist; on the other hand, they subverted them. There are
also common trends in the transformation of informal practices in post-reform China
and Russia. Before the reforms, both guanxixue and blat were often beneficial to
ordinary people in allowing them to satisfy their personal needs and in organising
their own lives, whereas now their shift into corruption benefits the official-business
classes and hurts the bulk of society. Trust and social networks are vital components
of both economies and will continue to exist (as elsewhere) but their implications for
the transformation may differ. The post-Soviet reforms have changed the Soviet-type
blat practices so much that blat has almost ceased to be a relevant term for the use of
personal networks both in the state and in the new sectors of the economy. Being
more culturally and historically grounded, the term guanxi has sustained and found its
new use in contemporary China. There is much more discussion of guanxi and guanxi
capitalism in China than ever has been on blat in Russia. The partiality of reforms in
China and the communist rulership does not prevent foreign investment and economic
success, and corruption is estimated as not as damaging in China as it is in Russia.

Title: The Estonian Organizations – The Subjects of Transformation
Abstract: Estonia stayed fifty years under the communist regime. Historically the organizations in the
former Soviet Union were carefully controlled by the state and served as the tools of controlling
individuals and groups. Estonia’s transition to a democratic society provides an intriguing context
for analyzing how organizations have changed. The goal of this paper is to show what kind of
changes took place in Estonian organizations in the framework of transition of the Estonian
society. The changes are discussed from the perspective of four organizational elements: people,
organizational goal, structure, and technology. This is an exploratory study, which enables
detecting several aspects of the business and public sector organizations, whereas the major focus
is on human behavior rather than on economic aspects of organizational life.

Title: Revisiting Consumption Smoothing and the 1998 Russian Crisis
Abstract:  Applying quantile regression techniques to Russian data we investigate the channels through
which individuals experience changes in their well being. We find that married individuals in
non-rural households with university-educated heads are less vulnerable to severe welfare
shocks. For the most vulnerable individuals the labour market plays a key role in transmitting the
effects of aggregate shocks through the unemployment channel whereas those individuals able to
maintain their employment status are more able to cope with economic shocks. While increases
in pension payments help individuals to cope with shocks, it transpires that vulnerable
individuals rely more broadly on the support of relatives and the produce of their garden plots
and dachas.

Title: Insurance Company Financial Management by Optimising Premium Level: the case of Poland.
Abstract:  The article, which falls within the terms of reference of insurance risk analysis, presents
research on the death risk regional differentiation and its influence on the level of insurance
and social security premiums.
The article is divided into four parts. The first one describes probability of death as a
measure of calculated death risk and presents synthetic results of death probability estimates
for individual Polish voivodships. In the second part net life insurance premiums calculated
separately for individual voivodships and premiums calculated with the average death risk
factor for the entire territory of Poland are compared. Part three discusses the effect of the
regional premium and death risk differentiation method on financial management of
insurance companies indicating the value of the insurance fund established. The said fund has
been calculated on the basis of the method presented and without the application of the
regional premium differentiation method. In conclusion, recommendations are made
concerning the possible application of the regional premium differentiation by insurance
companies.

Title: Autonomy and Capacity:
A state-centred approach to Post-communist transition in central Europe
Abstract:  The paper examines state characteristics and their policy implications in five Central
European post-communist countries. It argues that policies on macroeconomic
stabilisation, privatisation and FDI had been shaped by state-society relations, which,
in turn, had been affected by policy outcomes. Curiously, though, whereas structural
and institutional developments exhibited a great deal of path-dependency in some
countries, in others significant policy shifts took place. The conceptual tools of state
capacity and autonomy are used to describe both dynamics, as well as to explain the
spectacular variation in the role of FDI across the region.

Title: De-industrialisation and the Post-Communist Transition: Rowthorn and Wells’ Model Revisited
Abstract:  16 September 2005
In this paper we present a simple three-sector model explaining the structural change
in employment, which is a modified version of Rowthorn-Wells (1987). We
supplement the theoretical analysis with simple econometric tests, which illustrate
how the modified Rowthorn-Wells model can be used to (i) motivate empirical
estimates of the link between the level of development and structures of employment,
(ii) illustrate structural distortions under the command economies, and the structural
adjustment that happened during the post-Communist transition. We demonstrate that
in the case of these economies, the transition process leads to an adjustment to the
employment structures predicted by the model.

Title: Upgrading Russian Enterproses from the value chain perpective: The Case Study of Tube & Pipe, 
and Furniture Sectors
Abstract: The paper is the first analysis of the competitiveness of Russian enterprises from the 
perspective of value
chains, with a focus on the example of tube & pipe and furniture producers.  In both industries, Russian 
firms
enjoy an advantage on raw material side.  Nevertheless, the overall competitiveness level of Russian 
producers remains
modest.  Domestic industries primarily owe decreased competitiveness to the inadequate operation of 
the final links in the  
value chain:
from end-product production to end-product user.  In addition, the competitiveness of domestic 
producers is limited to the 
ability of key players in the chain to redistribute additional gains in their own favour. Study shows that 
any non-selective 
of supporting enterprises (such as tax reductions) exert extremely limited influence on the status of 
players in those chains
where one of the links is characterized by the serious entry barriers and related opportunities of rent 
redistribution in 
favour of a particular player.  Paper suggests several policy measures which aim to improve the ability 
of the producers
to reposition themselves along the chain and modify the chain itself

Title: The Promotion of Innovation in Slovenia through Knowledge Transfer from Higher Education 
Institutions to SME's
Abstract:  This paper provides an audit of Slovenian initiatives for promoting innovation in small and 
medium-sized  
enterprises (SME's) 
through knowledge transfer from Higher Education Institutions (HEI's).  The first two sections set out a 
brief review
of knowledge transfer and innovation performance in Slovenia, which shows that the country has 
managed to sustain a  
relatively
high level of public expenditure on research and development.  Slovenia has a relatively high 
proportion of employees and 
value-added in high technology manufacturing compared to the EU average.  However, innovation 
among SME's is relatively low 
compared to the average of EU member states. The next two sections review the research literature on 
knowledge transfer from 
HEI's to SME's, and describe the Slovenian government's innovation policy framework and the 
extensive programme to promote
knowledge transfer from HEI's to the business sector.  The penultimate section presents an audit of 
knowledge transfer  
policies in Slovenia, which covers policies towards SME incubators, technology parks, technology 
centres, technology  
networks, industrial clusters, financial subsidies for high-technology SME's, and the mobility 
programme for young  
researchers.  The audit is based on documentary evidence and interviews carried out in April 2005, and 
presents case studies  
of an innovative university-based incubator and a successful industrial in the automotive industry.
The paper concludes that although some of the measures have achieved a degree of success there are 
two key problems.
The first problem is that knowledge transfer policies are weakened by the strong demarcation between 
pure and applied  
research in the HEI sector.  Thus, although there us a degree of knowledge transfer from research 
institutes, there is little 
knowledge transfer from universities to the business sector.  Universities mainly pursue pure research 
and there are a few  
incentives for academics to commercialize their scientific activities.  The second problem is that the 
knowledge transfer  
activities that do take place between the research institutes and businesses largely by-pass the SME 
sector, and are mainly  
geared towards large companies. Consequently, SMEs fail to benefit from the governments extensive 
programme to support  
innovation and knowledge transfer.  It is not surprising therefore that Slovenia's SMEs have a relatively 
weak innovation  
performance.  The final section sets out a set of policy recommendations which we believe are 
necessary to redress this  
imbalance and to improve the practice of knowledge transfer from HEIs to SMEs in Slovenia.

Title: Reconstitution of Post-Soviet Ex-State Enterprises into Russian Business Firms Under 
Institutional Weaknesses
Abstract:  The paper provides an interpretation of the transformation of post-soviet Russian enterprises 
from the  
resource-based perspective of the firm in the context of institutional change.  Based on the resource-
based perspective,  
which conceptualises a firm as a collection of resources embedded in business functions that are 
organised within an  
administrative framework, this paper demonstrate that the restructuring of post soviet enterprises 
entailed their  
reorganisation or reconstitution into business units, able to engage in commercial activities and 
compete in a market  
orientated environment.  Building on the resource-based interpretation of the firm in the post-socialist 
context, and  
focusing on the institutional environment in which firms operate, the paper analyses the role of 
informal business practices  
in Russia - particularly in the area of corporate governance - form the reconstitution of post-soviet 
enterprises into  
business units.  Taking the case of Yukos Oil Company in the 1990s, it argues that considering 
informal practices in the  
context of fulfilling tasks of corporate reconstitution points to their functionality in the face of 
disintegration of the  
Soviet economic system and institutional weaknesses.

Title: Post-Communist Recessions Re-examined
Abstract:  We apply simple econometric methods to evaluate the factors that determined the
length and depth of the post-Communist recessions. Early implementation of the
stabilisation and liberalisation programmes made the recessions weaker. Wars had
strong negative impact. Initial trade dependence made recessions more serious. The
results are discussed with reference to the existing explanations of the ‘transitional
recessions’, in particular Calvo and Coricelli (1992, 1993), Blanchard and Kremer
(1997) and Blanchard (1997).

Title: Foreign Direct Investment and Restructuring in the Automotive Industry in Central and East 
Europe
Abstract:  This paper reviews and explores the major effects of the FDI on industry restructuring of the 
CEE automotive industry.  In particular, we are interested if automotive companies have exploited the 
value creation potential of CEE?  Which factors explain the scale and depth of automotive industry 
restructuring in CEE? What are the economic effects of restructuring the automotive industry in terms 
of employment, trade and technology? What has been the role of national and EU policies in shaping 
the FDI and restructuring in the CEE automotive industry? 
	Our results suggest that the value creation potential of CEE as a global automotive location 
has not yet been fully exploited with great differences across countries.  A combination of country 
specific factors (proximity to EU markets, socialist heritage in automotive industry, skilled labour and 
privatisation policies) couple with strategies of automotive MNCs have generated different country 
patterns and very different effects on industry.  Improvements in productivity and technology transfer 
in both embodied (equipment upgrading) and disembodied form (know how) are significant in 
countries with large FDI in automotive industry.  Employment effects are positive in particular in 
automotive suppliers industry.  Privatisation policy in early 1990s which was followed by a policy of 
attracting Greenfield FDI on the eve of the EU accession is crucial in explaining country differences in 
FDI PRESENCE.  Automotive investors have foreseen EU accession and in that respect, EU 
membership will not bring to changes in trend but possibly a deepening of the automotive cluster in 
central Europe.  However, whether this will happen or not will depend on the ability of CEECs to 
develop sector specific policies which would support the upgrading of local automotive suppliers.

Title: Financial Performance of Groups of Companies in Poland against the background of historical 
determinants and knowledge management procedures applied
Abstract: Polish businesses are passing the fifteen year mark of the free market experience.  The 
important processes that could be observed during that time include the formation of the groups of 
companies.  What were the establishment paths of these multiple organisations and what was the 
impact of historical determinants on their operation and financial performance?  What is the extent on 
contribution of subsidiaries to the financial performance of the groups? And finally what are the main 
drivers of their effectiveness in the context of group management system applied and knowledge 
management procedures?
This paper attempts to provide answers to these questions.  It presents insights, observations and 
selected findings of research conducted over the period of the last five years.  Its is shown that the 
operation of these organisations is on the one hand strongly determined by historical factors, and on the 
other the strength of this impact diminishes with time. Groups of companies see positive operational 
changes, reflected mainly in improved financial performance, growing significance of subsidiaries and 
the enhanced effectiveness of the management systems applied which are broadly based on knowledge 
management procedures.

Title: Are the EU New Member States Fiscally Sustainable? An Empirical Analysis
Abstract:  This paper discusses the theoretical aspects of fiscal sustainability and identities the
main sources of fiscal non-sustainability from the perspective of both general equilibrium models
and partial equilibrium models. The study adopts the partial equilibrium approach to investigate
empirically whether the EU New Member States are fiscally sustainable. The stationarity test
and cointegration analysis are employed to examine this issue. According to the debt stationarity
tests, countries such as Lithuania and Slovenia are the only ones that can be regarded as fiscally
sustainable. According to a cointegration analysis of government revenues and expenditures none of
the analysed countries is fiscally sustainable. However, analyses based on public debt stationarity
test and intertemporal budget constraint do not account for the costs associated with the transition
period, therefore the final conclusion of no sustainability in NMS should be put into a broader
context of transformation from a centrally planned economy to a market oriented system. This, of
course, should not be taken as an excuse for failing to pursue prudent fiscal policy aiming to ensure
sustainability over the long-term. The policy implication of this is that the vast majority of the
EU New Member States have to undertake significant corrective measures to ensure sustainability
over the long-term: certainly more than is being done at the present time.

Title: Growth Expectations of Business Owners Impact of Human Capital, Firm Characteristics and 
Environmental Transition
Abstract:  This paper presents an empirical study based on a survey of 399 owners of small and 
medium
size companies in Lithuania. Applying bivariate and ordered probit estimators, we investigate
why some business owners expect their firms to expand, while others do not. Our main
findings provide evidence that SME owner’s generic and specific human capital matter.
Those with higher education and ‘learning by doing’ attributes, either through previous job
experience or additional entrepreneurial experience, expect their businesses to expand. The
expectations of growth are positively related to exporting and non-monotonically to enterprise
size. In addition, we analyse the link between the perceptions of constraints to business
activities and growth expectations and find that the factors, which are perceived as main
business barriers, are not necessary those which are associated with reduced growth
expectations. In particular, perceptions of both corruption and of inadequate tax systems seem
to affect growth expectations the most.

Title: GROWTH, INTEGRATION AND SPILLOVERS IN THE CENTRAL AND EAST 
EUROPEAN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY
Abstract:  This paper explores growth and competitive advantage in CEE software firms; it looks at the
role of strategic partnerships and industry (spillover) effects. The empirical analysis is based
on survey data from 224 software firms from six CEE countries (Bulgaria, Czech R, Estonia,
Serbia, Slovenia, Romania). The results of the descriptive analysis are interpreted from the
perspective of the role of capabilities in industrial development. The analysis shows that the
patterns of growth are a mix of sector, region and sub--region specific determinants and show
important national differences. This suggests that the CEE software industry cannot be
considered as a homogenous phenomenon. There is no general tendency towards an
expansion in exports; based on our sample only Romania is developing an export oriented
software industry.
Research shows that the CEE software industry is populated by young, dedicated, domestic
firms, which are independent, and privately owned and which are mainly oriented towards
localisation of software. They are strongly dependent for trade and production on alliances
and strategic partnerships with foreign partners and a small share of technology based
partnerships. There is an extensive process of industry upgrading underway, involving
country and sub-region specific changes. The spillover effects are significant, through links
with clients and intensive intra-industry knowledge transfer through high employment
turnover and potentially high knowledge transfer from foreign to local projects. Differences
between central and eastern Europe are strong in terms of degree of diversification of
software supply, industrial upgrading and quality of demand.
The pattern of software development in CEE differs from that in other emerging markets in
the sense that it is domestic market oriented, but with an emerging export market for services.
Its further growth and upgrading will be strongly dependent on the acquisition of
organisational capabilities by local firms.

Title: NATURE AND DETERMINANTS OF PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH OF FOREIGN 
SUBSIDIARIES IN CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
Abstract: The paper examines the determinants of productivity growth in foreign manufacturing
subsidiaries in five Central and East European (CEE) countries by analysing patterns of
control, nature of firms’ capabilities and firms’ market orientation. Building on the so
called ‘developmental subsidiaries’ perspective we show that productivity growth is
determined jointly by corporate governance, production capability and market orientation
variables. CEE subsidiaries have relatively strong autonomy over control of their
business functions, but within a dominantly production oriented mandate. Majority
foreign equity share has a significant and positive impact on subsidiaries’ productivity
growth. These results present very strong regional characteristic.

Title: BETWEEN VISION AND REALITY: PROMOTING INNOVATION THROUGH 
TECHNOPARKS IN KAZAKHSTAN
Abstract: A common motivation for the technopark movement is the belief that technoparks promote
innovation and economic growth at regional and/or national levels. The paper analyses the
role of technoparks as instruments of innovation promotion in Kazakhstan using data from a
firm survey and interviews. Our results suggest that, unlike what is assumed in the innovation
policy literature, technoparks do not house firms dealing with the commercialisation of
innovations that are ready for introduction to the market. Technopark firms are no more
innovative than other firms. They are oriented largely towards the local market, and operate in
traditional sectors; the frequency and intensity of their external links are more developed than
are their internal links. The key motivations for relocating to a technopark seem to be lower
rents and the possibility of accessing finance. Overall, Kazakh technoparks seem to be
successful in terms of facilitating business incubation, but much les so in terms of innovation
promotion and diversification of the economy. Currently, Kazakh industry does not make any
demands for local R&D, and its sources of competitiveness lie in non-R&D activities. This
suggests that innovation policy should focus on assisting companies to upgrade their
technological capabilities to the level that they can articulate their R&D demands. Focusing
on technoparks as the main mechanism to improve competitiveness and diversify the
economy is an ineffective and uncertain a policy option at this stage of the country’s
economic development. However, there seems to be significant scope for supporting business
incubation. These conclusions are of relevance to other emerging economies.

Title: FISCAL TRANSPARENCY AND POLICY RULES IN POLAND
Abstract: This paper assesses the current stance and desirable progress in the implementation of
fiscal transparency and rules in Poland. An index of transparency based on Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), with some modifications, is also
constructed in this paper, followed by proposals for making transparency and fiscal rules
more efficient within Poland’s fiscal policy. This study attempts to answer the following questions: Firstly, to what extent is fiscal policy transparent in the context of the
standards set by the EU’s regulations and the IMF’s ROSC? Secondly, have the fiscal
rules adopted by Poland proved to be successful in establishing fiscal policy discipline?
Finally, what still needs to be changed to make both transparency and fiscal rules more
efficient for the conduct of fiscal policy? To set the work in context we also provide an
overview of recent advances in both the theoretical and empirical literature on fiscal
transparency and rules.

Title: Construction of Home by Polish and Lithuanian Migrants in the UK
Abstract: Researchers across the social sciences and humanities have sought to understand the nature of 
people’s
affiliation with a particular place, to understand the emotional and symbolic ties that bind people to a
place and make them feel at home. The concept of home becomes especially complex when analysed
in the light of migration. In this context Gilles Deleuza and Felix Guattari (1987) invent a pair of concepts: ‘homing of diaspora’ and ‘diasporising of home’. These two phrases express the essence of
diasporic existence: on one hand, ‘home’ and especially nostalgia for home left behind is infused into
the very notion of diaspora; on the other hand, diasporas take their ‘home’ with them when they travel
and reconstruct ‘home’ in the new environment. This article analyses how these processes of home
creation take place among the new Polish and Lithuanian migrants in the UK, based on interviews
conducted with migrant workers for the research project ‘Changing Status, Changing Lives?’ carried
out by the University of Oxford.

Title: Ownership Structure and Development of Polish Life Insurance Companies: Evidence from 1991 
to 2004
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the relationship between changes in the
ownership structure and the development of life insurance companies in Poland. The simple
regression model is used to reveal the relation. The findings of this study, that the solvency
ratio, overall indebtedness ratio, premiums retention ratio and profitability ratio on technical
activity and sales are positively related with the changes in the share of foreign capital and
especially that the claims ratio is negatively related, suggest that foreign investments have
greatly influenced the development of the life insurance industry in Poland during the
transition period.

Title: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, MANAGERS’ INDEPENDENCE, EXPORTING AND 
PERFORMANCE OF FIRMS IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES
Abstract: Using data on 157 large companies in Poland and Hungary this paper employs Bayesian
structural equation modeling to examine interrelationships between corporate
governance, managers’ independence from owners in terms of strategic decision-making,
exporting and performance. It is found that managers’ independence is positively
associated with firms’ financial performance and exporting. In turn, the extent of
managers’ independence is contingent on the firm’s corporate governance parameters: it
is negatively associated with ownership concentration, but positively associated with the
percentage of foreign directors on the firm’s board. We interpret these results as an
indication that (i) risk averse, concentrated owners tend to constrain managerial
autonomy at the cost of the firm’s internationalization and performance, (ii) board
participation of foreign stakeholders, on the other hand, enhances the firm’s export
orientation and performance by encouraging executives’ decision-making autonomy.

Title:  Entrepreneurship in Transition Countries: A Review
Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the key issues surrounding 
entrepreneurship
development in transition countries focusing on six main themes. Though it can be argued that the
transition countries started from more or less the same point when they embarked on their
transitional path, in this paper, we indicate a number of the differences in initial conditions which
further influenced SME development. By surveying the existing literature on SME development,
this paper illustrates that as the transition process progresses, entrepreneurship development in
transition countries is a story of increasing divergence. The transitional context provides
unique opportunities for entrepreneurship activities to develop. However, at the same
time this environment presents unique challenges for entrepreneurial development
especially knowledge-based entrepreneurship as the free-market system matures within a
context with low levels of SMEs and inherited negative views towards entrepreneurship.

Title: New Estimates of the Risk and Duration of Registered Unemployment in Urban Russia
Abstract: This paper examines whether deregistration from the employment office decreases
unemployment duration. The study is based on Russian individual-level data from the
Public Employment Office of Rostov-on-Don combined with information from the
2000 household survey. Using a proportional hazard model, I find a significant excess
in job finding rates following employment office deregistration. The predicted risk of
getting a job is non-monotonic and tends to decrease at longer duration intervals. An
important finding is that only 29% of the unemployed obtained a job simultaneously
with deregistering from the Public Employment Office. Others continued to search for
job on their own.

Title:  Institutions, Infrastructure, and Trade
Abstract:  We examine the influence of infrastructure, institutional quality, colonial and geographic 
context, and trade
preferences on the pattern of bilateral trade. We are interested in threshold effects, and so emphasize 
those cases
where bilateral country pairs do not actually trade. We depart from the institutions and infrastructure 
literature in
this respect, using selection-based gravity modeling of trade flows. We also depart from this literature 
by mixing
principal components (to condense our institutional and infrastructure measures) with a focus on 
deviations in the
resulting indexes from expected values for given income cohorts to control for multicollinearity. We 
work with a
panel of 284,049 bilateral trade flows from 1988 to 2002. Matching bilateral trade and tariff data and 
controlling
for tariff preferences, level of development, and standard distance measures, we find that infrastructure, 
and
institutional quality, are significant determinants not only of export levels, but also of the likelihood 
exports will
take place at all. Our results support the notion that export performance, and the propensity to take part 
in the
trading system at all, depends on institutional quality and access to well developed transport and 
communications
infrastructure. Indeed, this dependence is far more important, empirically, than variations in tariffs in 
explaining
sample variations in North-South trade.

Title:  The Great Divide: “Ruralisation” of Poverty in Russia
Abstract:  Using data from the RLMS for the period 2000-2004 we investigate poverty trends in
Russia. We find that urban poverty declines at twice the rate of rural poverty so that by
2004 poverty in Russia had become a largely rural phenomenon for the first time since
transition began. This finding does not stem from changing population characteristics or
shares, is not dependent on the use of a particular poverty line nor is it driven by the rapid
expansions that have occurred in Moscow, St. Petersburg or other urban areas. Our
findings flesh out those of Ravallion et al (2007) who, in contrast to other regions, “find
signs” of a ruralisation of poverty in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. We
attribute some of the differential to the labour market.

Title: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITIVENESS IN SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE: ASSET OR LIABILITY FOR EU INTEGRATION? 
Abstract:  This paper explores the relationship between research and development (R&D) and
competitiveness of the SEE economies from the perspective of the EU integration and the
EU as a knowledge based economy. Specifically, paper addresses the question of
whether SEE is a potential asset or a liability in this process.
SEE countries are quite diverse in terms of levels of competitiveness, with visible effects
on the role of R&D which is confirmed by analysis of the demand and supply factors of
R&D. Although tentative, results show that innovation policy that takes account of the
supply and demand side factors of R&D is essential to knowledge based growth in the
SEE economies. This poses some limits to traditionally defined S&T policy as a sectoral
activity and calls for new approaches, which are discussed in the paper.

Title: Inequality, Democracy and Taxation: Lessons from the Post-Communist Transition
Abstract:  Using data for post-communist economies (1989-2002), we examine the determinants of 
income inequality. We
find a strong positive association between equality and tax collection but note that this relationship is 
significantly
stronger under authoritarian regimes than under democracies. We also discover that early 
macroeconomic
stabilisation resulted in lower inequality; we confirm that education fosters equality and find that larger 
countries
are prone to higher levels of inequality.

Title: National Systems of Innovation and Entrepreneurship: In Search of a Missing Link
Abstract:  The literature on national systems of innovation (NIS) has neglected the issue of
entrepreneurship because of several incompatibilities between the two notions.
The Schumpeterian legacy, the current person-centric view of entrepreneurship,
and methodological problems related to treating entrepreneurship at the macrolevel,
have made it difficult to integrate entrepreneurship into the NIS perspective.
At national level it is more appropriate to treat entrepreneurship as a ‘property’
(dimension) of NIS. In order to link NIS and entrepreneurship we must establish a common conceptual
basis. Our argument is that the functional view of NIS and entrepreneurship
presents a common basis for such an approach. We develop criteria for the
entrepreneurial NIS which we define as being those that can change balance
between individual and cooperative entrepreneurship; that enhance both the
opportunity and skill aspects of entrepreneurship; and that can balance generation
of uncertainty with support to business models and other organisations which pool
uncertainty. From the NIS perspective, we explain entrepreneurship as a systemic phenomenon
driven by complementarities between technological, market and institutional
opportunities. This framework builds on three research traditions in the
entrepreneurship/NIS literature (Schumpeterian, Kirznerian and Listian) which
jointly form a multi-level, multi-dimensional framework for understanding
entrepreneurship from a NIS perspective. This framework could be useful as a
heuristic for empirical research on entrepreneurship. Finally, we analyse policies
for entrepreneurship and find that they are highly dependent on underlying and
previously discussed conceptions of entrepreneurship.

Title: Convergence across Russian Regions: A Spatial Econometrics Approach
Abstract:  This paper analyses the process of convergence across the regions of Russia using spatial
econometrics tools in addition to the traditional ß-convergence techniques as derived from the
neoclassical theoretical setting. The spatial component appears to be non-negligible and,
consequently, conventional convergence estimates suffer a bias due to spatial dependence across
observations. Furthermore, variables such as hydrocarbon supply, openness to trade and FDI per
capita are found to have an unambiguous, positive and statistically significant impact on growth
(Results are also confirmed by the panel counterpart of the model. Estimates for this last are presented

Title: Knowledge Based Entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary: Results from 4 case studies.
Abstract:  This paper describes knowledge based entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary, in particular the growth and development process of 4 firms are studied:
Dekonta, an environmental services firm, Et netera, an IT services firm, both
operating in Czech Republic, along with a data recovery firm, Kurt, and a
biopharmaceutical firm, Solvo, both operating in Hungary. The objectives of the case
studies are to illustrate experiences of knowledge based entrepreneurship within a
transition environment in terms of their different growth and development paths.
By carrying out in depth case studies using semi structured interviews with the
founders, top management teams, core employees and key stakeholders in industrial
associations I am able to explain the growth process of entrepreneurial knowledge
based ventures. I assume an ecological view of the firm and examine the role of
internal, strategic, network and external factors in this development process. I propose
that the relative importance of these factors evolve over time from start up to
maturity. Moreover, I anticipate that there will be complementarities between these
factors in the spirit of Milgrom and Roberts (1995) and Von Tunzelmann (2003).  This approach 
should help us better understand the complex nature of
entrepreneurship. The key contributions of these case studies are the application of an ecological
conceptual framework to the development of knowledge based firms in Central and
Eastern Europe, and so the viability of this model is tested within the transition
environment. I follow the recommendations by Ireland et al. (2005) and introduce a
temporal element in order to analyse the shift in importance of the factors impacting
on firm development and growth, thus hoping to deal with some of the criticisms on
existing entrepreneurial research.

Title: Do Institutions Matter for Technological Change in
Transition Economies?  The Case of Russia’s 89 regions and republics.
Abstract:  We explore the impact of institutions on technological change in a transition
economy. We use regional panel data for Russia’s 89 regions and republics during the
period of recovery and growth from 1998 to 2004 to show the impact of large
variation in institutional development, ranging from full enforcement of property
rights in the Northwest to red belt Communist regimes in the southeast. We find an
unambiguous relationship between strong and sustained institutional development and
technological change. We provide one model proxying the quality of institutions by
the investment risk rating compiled by the rating agency ExpertRA Regions. (JEL:
