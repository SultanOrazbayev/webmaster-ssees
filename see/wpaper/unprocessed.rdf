Title: Knowledge Based Entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary: Results from 4 case studies.
Abstract:  This paper describes knowledge based entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary, in particular the growth and development process of 4 firms are studied:
Dekonta, an environmental services firm, Et netera, an IT services firm, both
operating in Czech Republic, along with a data recovery firm, Kurt, and a
biopharmaceutical firm, Solvo, both operating in Hungary. The objectives of the case
studies are to illustrate experiences of knowledge based entrepreneurship within a
transition environment in terms of their different growth and development paths.
By carrying out in depth case studies using semi structured interviews with the
founders, top management teams, core employees and key stakeholders in industrial
associations I am able to explain the growth process of entrepreneurial knowledge
based ventures. I assume an ecological view of the firm and examine the role of
internal, strategic, network and external factors in this development process. I propose
that the relative importance of these factors evolve over time from start up to
maturity. Moreover, I anticipate that there will be complementarities between these
factors in the spirit of Milgrom and Roberts (1995) and Von Tunzelmann (2003).  This approach 
should help us better understand the complex nature of
entrepreneurship. The key contributions of these case studies are the application of an ecological
conceptual framework to the development of knowledge based firms in Central and
Eastern Europe, and so the viability of this model is tested within the transition
environment. I follow the recommendations by Ireland et al. (2005) and introduce a
temporal element in order to analyse the shift in importance of the factors impacting
on firm development and growth, thus hoping to deal with some of the criticisms on
existing entrepreneurial research.

Title: Do Institutions Matter for Technological Change in
Transition Economies?  The Case of Russia’s 89 regions and republics.
Abstract:  We explore the impact of institutions on technological change in a transition
economy. We use regional panel data for Russia’s 89 regions and republics during the
period of recovery and growth from 1998 to 2004 to show the impact of large
variation in institutional development, ranging from full enforcement of property
rights in the Northwest to red belt Communist regimes in the southeast. We find an
unambiguous relationship between strong and sustained institutional development and
technological change. We provide one model proxying the quality of institutions by
the investment risk rating compiled by the rating agency ExpertRA Regions. (JEL:
