Title: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, MANAGERS’ INDEPENDENCE, EXPORTING AND 
PERFORMANCE OF FIRMS IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES
Abstract: Using data on 157 large companies in Poland and Hungary this paper employs Bayesian
structural equation modeling to examine interrelationships between corporate
governance, managers’ independence from owners in terms of strategic decision-making,
exporting and performance. It is found that managers’ independence is positively
associated with firms’ financial performance and exporting. In turn, the extent of
managers’ independence is contingent on the firm’s corporate governance parameters: it
is negatively associated with ownership concentration, but positively associated with the
percentage of foreign directors on the firm’s board. We interpret these results as an
indication that (i) risk averse, concentrated owners tend to constrain managerial
autonomy at the cost of the firm’s internationalization and performance, (ii) board
participation of foreign stakeholders, on the other hand, enhances the firm’s export
orientation and performance by encouraging executives’ decision-making autonomy.

Title:  Entrepreneurship in Transition Countries: A Review
Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the key issues surrounding 
entrepreneurship
development in transition countries focusing on six main themes. Though it can be argued that the
transition countries started from more or less the same point when they embarked on their
transitional path, in this paper, we indicate a number of the differences in initial conditions which
further influenced SME development. By surveying the existing literature on SME development,
this paper illustrates that as the transition process progresses, entrepreneurship development in
transition countries is a story of increasing divergence. The transitional context provides
unique opportunities for entrepreneurship activities to develop. However, at the same
time this environment presents unique challenges for entrepreneurial development
especially knowledge-based entrepreneurship as the free-market system matures within a
context with low levels of SMEs and inherited negative views towards entrepreneurship.

Title: New Estimates of the Risk and Duration of Registered Unemployment in Urban Russia
Abstract: This paper examines whether deregistration from the employment office decreases
unemployment duration. The study is based on Russian individual-level data from the
Public Employment Office of Rostov-on-Don combined with information from the
2000 household survey. Using a proportional hazard model, I find a significant excess
in job finding rates following employment office deregistration. The predicted risk of
getting a job is non-monotonic and tends to decrease at longer duration intervals. An
important finding is that only 29% of the unemployed obtained a job simultaneously
with deregistering from the Public Employment Office. Others continued to search for
job on their own.

Title:  Institutions, Infrastructure, and Trade
Abstract:  We examine the influence of infrastructure, institutional quality, colonial and geographic 
context, and trade
preferences on the pattern of bilateral trade. We are interested in threshold effects, and so emphasize 
those cases
where bilateral country pairs do not actually trade. We depart from the institutions and infrastructure 
literature in
this respect, using selection-based gravity modeling of trade flows. We also depart from this literature 
by mixing
principal components (to condense our institutional and infrastructure measures) with a focus on 
deviations in the
resulting indexes from expected values for given income cohorts to control for multicollinearity. We 
work with a
panel of 284,049 bilateral trade flows from 1988 to 2002. Matching bilateral trade and tariff data and 
controlling
for tariff preferences, level of development, and standard distance measures, we find that infrastructure, 
and
institutional quality, are significant determinants not only of export levels, but also of the likelihood 
exports will
take place at all. Our results support the notion that export performance, and the propensity to take part 
in the
trading system at all, depends on institutional quality and access to well developed transport and 
communications
infrastructure. Indeed, this dependence is far more important, empirically, than variations in tariffs in 
explaining
sample variations in North-South trade.

Title:  The Great Divide: “Ruralisation” of Poverty in Russia
Abstract:  Using data from the RLMS for the period 2000-2004 we investigate poverty trends in
Russia. We find that urban poverty declines at twice the rate of rural poverty so that by
2004 poverty in Russia had become a largely rural phenomenon for the first time since
transition began. This finding does not stem from changing population characteristics or
shares, is not dependent on the use of a particular poverty line nor is it driven by the rapid
expansions that have occurred in Moscow, St. Petersburg or other urban areas. Our
findings flesh out those of Ravallion et al (2007) who, in contrast to other regions, “find
signs” of a ruralisation of poverty in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. We
attribute some of the differential to the labour market.

Title: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITIVENESS IN SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE: ASSET OR LIABILITY FOR EU INTEGRATION? 
Abstract:  This paper explores the relationship between research and development (R&D) and
competitiveness of the SEE economies from the perspective of the EU integration and the
EU as a knowledge based economy. Specifically, paper addresses the question of
whether SEE is a potential asset or a liability in this process.
SEE countries are quite diverse in terms of levels of competitiveness, with visible effects
on the role of R&D which is confirmed by analysis of the demand and supply factors of
R&D. Although tentative, results show that innovation policy that takes account of the
supply and demand side factors of R&D is essential to knowledge based growth in the
SEE economies. This poses some limits to traditionally defined S&T policy as a sectoral
activity and calls for new approaches, which are discussed in the paper.

Title: Inequality, Democracy and Taxation: Lessons from the Post-Communist Transition
Abstract:  Using data for post-communist economies (1989-2002), we examine the determinants of 
income inequality. We
find a strong positive association between equality and tax collection but note that this relationship is 
significantly
stronger under authoritarian regimes than under democracies. We also discover that early 
macroeconomic
stabilisation resulted in lower inequality; we confirm that education fosters equality and find that larger 
countries
are prone to higher levels of inequality.

Title: National Systems of Innovation and Entrepreneurship: In Search of a Missing Link
Abstract:  The literature on national systems of innovation (NIS) has neglected the issue of
entrepreneurship because of several incompatibilities between the two notions.
The Schumpeterian legacy, the current person-centric view of entrepreneurship,
and methodological problems related to treating entrepreneurship at the macrolevel,
have made it difficult to integrate entrepreneurship into the NIS perspective.
At national level it is more appropriate to treat entrepreneurship as a ‘property’
(dimension) of NIS. In order to link NIS and entrepreneurship we must establish a common conceptual
basis. Our argument is that the functional view of NIS and entrepreneurship
presents a common basis for such an approach. We develop criteria for the
entrepreneurial NIS which we define as being those that can change balance
between individual and cooperative entrepreneurship; that enhance both the
opportunity and skill aspects of entrepreneurship; and that can balance generation
of uncertainty with support to business models and other organisations which pool
uncertainty. From the NIS perspective, we explain entrepreneurship as a systemic phenomenon
driven by complementarities between technological, market and institutional
opportunities. This framework builds on three research traditions in the
entrepreneurship/NIS literature (Schumpeterian, Kirznerian and Listian) which
jointly form a multi-level, multi-dimensional framework for understanding
entrepreneurship from a NIS perspective. This framework could be useful as a
heuristic for empirical research on entrepreneurship. Finally, we analyse policies
for entrepreneurship and find that they are highly dependent on underlying and
previously discussed conceptions of entrepreneurship.

Title: Convergence across Russian Regions: A Spatial Econometrics Approach
Abstract:  This paper analyses the process of convergence across the regions of Russia using spatial
econometrics tools in addition to the traditional ß-convergence techniques as derived from the
neoclassical theoretical setting. The spatial component appears to be non-negligible and,
consequently, conventional convergence estimates suffer a bias due to spatial dependence across
observations. Furthermore, variables such as hydrocarbon supply, openness to trade and FDI per
capita are found to have an unambiguous, positive and statistically significant impact on growth
(Results are also confirmed by the panel counterpart of the model. Estimates for this last are presented

Title: Knowledge Based Entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary: Results from 4 case studies.
Abstract:  This paper describes knowledge based entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic
and Hungary, in particular the growth and development process of 4 firms are studied:
Dekonta, an environmental services firm, Et netera, an IT services firm, both
operating in Czech Republic, along with a data recovery firm, Kurt, and a
biopharmaceutical firm, Solvo, both operating in Hungary. The objectives of the case
studies are to illustrate experiences of knowledge based entrepreneurship within a
transition environment in terms of their different growth and development paths.
By carrying out in depth case studies using semi structured interviews with the
founders, top management teams, core employees and key stakeholders in industrial
associations I am able to explain the growth process of entrepreneurial knowledge
based ventures. I assume an ecological view of the firm and examine the role of
internal, strategic, network and external factors in this development process. I propose
that the relative importance of these factors evolve over time from start up to
maturity. Moreover, I anticipate that there will be complementarities between these
factors in the spirit of Milgrom and Roberts (1995) and Von Tunzelmann (2003).  This approach 
should help us better understand the complex nature of
entrepreneurship. The key contributions of these case studies are the application of an ecological
conceptual framework to the development of knowledge based firms in Central and
Eastern Europe, and so the viability of this model is tested within the transition
environment. I follow the recommendations by Ireland et al. (2005) and introduce a
temporal element in order to analyse the shift in importance of the factors impacting
on firm development and growth, thus hoping to deal with some of the criticisms on
existing entrepreneurial research.

Title: Do Institutions Matter for Technological Change in
Transition Economies?  The Case of Russia’s 89 regions and republics.
Abstract:  We explore the impact of institutions on technological change in a transition
economy. We use regional panel data for Russia’s 89 regions and republics during the
period of recovery and growth from 1998 to 2004 to show the impact of large
variation in institutional development, ranging from full enforcement of property
rights in the Northwest to red belt Communist regimes in the southeast. We find an
unambiguous relationship between strong and sustained institutional development and
technological change. We provide one model proxying the quality of institutions by
the investment risk rating compiled by the rating agency ExpertRA Regions. (JEL:
