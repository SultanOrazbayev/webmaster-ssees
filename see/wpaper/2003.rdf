Title: The emerging industrial architecture of the wider Europe: The co-evolution of industrial and 
political structures
Abstract:  Project results show that the international industrial networks in CEE are organized by
MNCs and are limited in scope (mainly intra-firm). The weakest node for further industry
upgrading via network alignment is a national network. There are big national differences in
network alignment across CEECs. These differences reflect differences in the strategies of
MNCs; the different roles of governments in different industries and countries; and the
different positions of local authorities. EU demand operates as a strong ‘focal point’
(attractor) for the emergence of new industry networks. EU demand generates the necessary
‘coherence’ for initial and still rudimentary local clustering organized by MNCs. Differences
in accession to the EU play a secondary role in market driven industrial networks. However,
in sectors where regulations are important (energy, telecoms, pharmaceuticals) network
alignment is strongly shaped by State regulations. The global political economy as well as EU
accession has shifted CEE states towards a regulatory role. Formal policy alignment with the
EU (deep policy integration) leaves unresolved the problem of conflicts and gaps in policy
implementation. This may have a significant effect on patterns of industry integration in
some sectors in the future. CEE states will have to learn how to influence industrial
development in their territory using structural assistance while at the same time complying
with the EU regulatory requirements.

Title: Corporate Governance and Industrial Relations in Poland
Abstract:  The paper discusses Polish privatisation from the industrial relations point of view. It
focuses on the role of trade unions and workers councils in the privatisation process.
Two polar privatisation blueprints are identified: those aiming at competitive ‘atomistic’
firms and those, which accentuate corporate financial-industrial structures and networks.
The internal structure of corporate control in Polish companies is evaluated from this
perspective, taking into account the role of organised labour, of the managers and of the
politicians in the privatisation process.
