Title: The influence of alliances on corporate growth in the post-soviet period: LUKoil and YUKOS
Abstract: What is the role of alliances in the growth of Russian enterprises? Who is in control in alliances, i.e. are they shared alliances or is one party dominant? How do the various resources (technology, finance and market access) shape the dynamics of alliances? This paper tries to answer on these three questions by analyzing the role of alliances in growth of LUKoil and Yukos, Russian major oil companies. Based on these two cases we argue that technical modernization and growth are closely dependent on the capability of corporations to use alliances as a mechanism of growth and improved performance. In addition, there is a trade off between an immediate focus on operational efficiency and a focus on growth, which is key to the successful management of the growth of companies in the long-term.

Title: Corporate control and governance practices in Russia
Abstract: In Russia, the problem of corporate governance has become a frequent subject for discussion. Stories now abound about questionable corporate governance practices, such as share dilution, asset stripping, transfer pricing, complex ownership structures, limiting shareholders from attending the shareholders meetings. These practices, which have come to constitute corporate governance abuses to company shareholders, are considered to be factors adversely affecting the investment climate. At first glance, these non-transparent practices are a collection of independent cases of managerial malfeasance that are abusive to investors. However, there seems to be an internal logic in these widely used practices, as they have been functional for Russian corporates to navigate through circumstances characterised by an imperfect formal framework. The aim of this paper is to analyse such functionalities of the practices in light of an evolution of corporate Russia. Taking Yukos Oil Company as a case study, the paper demonstrates that resorting to these practices was instrumental in a process of ensuring corporate survival and strengthening market position by establishing a coherent corporate entity. This paper emphasises that these practices represent rational and logical responses by economic agents to the prevailing conditions shaped by policy choices, political and macroeconomic environment, and institutions.

Title: Income diversity in rural Lithuania: benefits, barriers, and incentives
Abstract: Economic hardship, agricultural policy reform and price developments have adversely affected incomes from agricultural production in Lithuania, and many farm households have accessed additional sources of income in the rural economy. In an analysis of recently collected survey data we find that non-farm wage employment particularly benefits poorer household, whereas non-agricultural enterprises are more common among higher-income farm households. Such enterprises diminish transaction problems typical for transition economies, allow households to capture more value added than in agricultural production, and create jobs in the local economy. Non-agricultural enterprises are more likely to be found with larger households and in more remote areas. Non-agricultural employment are more important income components for households that have more dependant members, are located in remoter areas, and have less access to economic institutions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of rural income diversity in economic regeneration.

Title: A two-tier or multi-tier Europe?: Assessing the Innovation capacities of Central and East European Countries in the Enlarged EU
Abstract: This paper assesses the innovation capacities of the central and east European (CEE) candidate countries and the countries of the EU using a set of 25 indicators organized within the national innovation capacity (NIC) framework. Based on regression and cluster analysis the paper shows that NIC in the enlarged EU does not follow a simple ‘East – West’ divide. The wider Europe is structured into three groups of countries and CEE countries are fall into two, the less developed and medium developed EU, groups. NICs in the enlarged EU are assessed across four dimensions of capacity: absorptive, R&D, diffusion and demand. In each of these dimensions we observe a two- or three-tiering of countries, which goes beyond a simple ‘East’ – ‘ West’ pattern. The results of this assessment have important implications for candidate countries as well as for the EU policy towards structural assistance.

Title: The emerging industrial architecture of the wider Europe: The co-evolution of industrial and political structures
Abstract: Project results show that the international industrial networks in CEE are organized by MNCs and are limited in scope (mainly intra-firm). The weakest node for further industry upgrading via network alignment is a national network. There are big national differences in network alignment across CEECs. These differences reflect differences in the strategies of MNCs; the different roles of governments in different industries and countries; and the different positions of local authorities. EU demand operates as a strong 'focal point' (attractor) for the emergence of new industry networks. EU demand generates the necessary 'coherence' for initial and still rudimentary local clustering organized by MNCs. Differences in accession to the EU play a secondary role in market driven industrial networks. However, in sectors where regulations are important (energy, telecoms, pharmaceuticals) network alignment is strongly shaped by State regulations. The global political economy as well as EU accession has shifted CEE states towards a regulatory role. Formal policy alignment with the EU (deep policy integration) leaves unresolved the problem of conflicts and gaps in policy implementation. This may have a significant effect on patterns of industry integration in some sectors in the future. CEE states will have to learn how to influence industrial development in their territory using structural assistance while at the same time complying with the EU regulatory requirements.

Title: Corporate Governance and Industrial Relations in Poland
Abstract: The paper discusses Polish privatisation from the industrial relations point of view. It focuses on the role of trade unions and workers councils in the privatisation process. Two polar privatisation blueprints are identified: those aiming at competitive 'atomistic' firms and those, which accentuate corporate financial-industrial structures and networks. The internal structure of corporate control in Polish companies is evaluated from this perspective, taking into account the role of organised labour, of the managers and of the politicians in the privatisation process.
