Title: De-industrialisation and the post-communist transition: Rowthorn and Wells' model revisited
Abstract: In this paper we present a simple three-sector model explaining the structural change in employment, which is a modified version of Rowthorn-Wells (1987). We supplement the theoretical analysis with simple econometric tests, which illustrate how the modified Rowthorn-Wells model can be used to (i) motivate empirical estimates of the link between the level of development and structures of employment, (ii) illustrate structural distortions under the command economies, and the structural adjustment that happened during the post-Communist transition. We demonstrate that in the case of these economies, the transition process leads to an adjustment to the employment structures predicted by the model.

Title: Upgrading Russian enterprises from the value chain perspective: the case study of tube & pipe, and furniture sectors
Abstract: The paper is the first analysis of the competitiveness of Russian enterprises from the perspective of value chains, with a focus on the example of tube & pipe and furniture producers. In both industries, Russian firms enjoy an advantage on the raw material side. Nevertheless, the overall competitiveness level of Russian producers remains modest. Domestic industries primarily owe decreased competitiveness to the inadequate operation of the final links in the value chain: from end-product production to the end-user. In addition, the competitiveness of domestic producers is limited to the ability of key players in the chain to redistribute additional gains in their own favor. Study shows that any non-selective methods of supporting enterprises (such as tax reductions) exert extremely limited influence on the status of players in those chains where one of the links is characterized by serious entry barriers and related opportunities of rent redistribution in favor of a particular player. Paper suggests several policy measures which aim to improve the ability of the producers to reposition themselves along the chain or to modify the chain itself.

Title: The promotion of innovation in Slovenia through knowledge transfer from higher education institutions to SME's
Abstract: This paper provides an audit of Slovenian initiatives for promoting innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through knowledge transfer from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The first two sections set out a brief review of knowledge transfer and innovation performance in Slovenia, which shows that the country has managed to sustain a relatively high level of public expenditure on research and development. Slovenia has a relatively high proportion of employees and value-added in high technology manufacturing compared to the EU average. However, innovation among SMEs is relatively low compared to the average of EU member states. The next two sections review the research literature on knowledge transfer from HEIs to SMEs, and describe the Slovenian government's innovation policy framework and the extensive programme to promote knowledge transfer from HEIs to the business sector. The penultimate section presents an audit of knowledge transfer policies in Slovenia, which covers policies towards SME incubators, technology parks, technology centres, technology networks, industrial clusters, financial subsidies for high-technology SMEs, and the mobility programme for young researchers. The audit is based on documentary evidence and interviews carried out in April 2005, and presents case studies of an innovative university-based incubator and a successful industrial cluster in the automotive industry. The paper concludes that although some of the measures have achieved a degree of success, there are two key problems. The first problem is that knowledge transfer policies are weakened by the strong demarcation between pure and applied research in the HEI sector. Thus, although there is a degree of knowledge transfer from research institutes, there is little knowledge transfer from universities to the business sector. Universities mainly pursue pure research and there are few incentives for academics to commercialize their scientific activities. The second problem is that the knowledge transfer activities that do take place between the research institutes and businesses largely by-pass the SME sector, and are mainly geared towards large companies. Consequently, SMEs fail to benefit from the government's extensive programme to support innovation and knowledge transfer. It is not surprising therefore that Slovenia's SMEs have a relatively weak innovation performance. The final section sets out a set of policy recommendations which we believe are necessary to redress this imbalance and to improve the practice of knowledge transfer from HEIs to SMEs in Slovenia.

Title: Reconstitution of post-soviet ex-state enterprises into Russian business firms under institutional weaknesses
Abstract: The paper provides an interpretation of the transformation of post-soviet Russian enterprises from the resource-based perspective of the firm in the context of institutional change. Based on the resource-based perspective, which conceptualises a firm as a collection of resources embedded in business functions that are organised within an administrative framework, this paper demonstrates that the restructuring of post-Soviet enterprises entailed their reorganisation or reconstitution into business units, able to engage in commercial activities and compete in a market oriented environment. Building on the resource-based interpretation of the firm in the post-socialist context, and focusing on the institutional environment in which firms operate, the paper analyses the role of informal business practices in Russia - particularly in the area of corporate governance - from the perspective of reconstitution of post-soviet enterprises into business units. Taking the case of Yukos Oil Company in the 1990s, it argues that considering informal practices in the context of fulfilling tasks of corporate reconstitution points to their functionality in the face of disintegration of the Soviet economic system and institutional weaknesses.

Title: Firms' capabilities related to the economic system: cases from Ukraine and Russia
Abstract: This paper suggests that certain capabilities of the firm are functional to the type of economic system (socialist, capitalist, transitional, etc.) in which the firm has to operate. Their presence in a firm can be an important factor in explaining its ability to survive and develop. It also suggests that concepts and definitions of the firm, offered by writers who have employed evolutionary and institutionalist models, yield useful perspectives on the processes of transition at the level of the individual enterprise. Cases from Russia and Ukraine are used to investigate this conjecture and to identify those capabilities distinctive to a market economy, in contrast with those required by their previous economic system. The capabilities, which have been conspicuously absent from the firms, which were relatively unsuccessful in adapting to the market economy, appear to relate particularly to management of purchasing, of innovation, of quality control, sales and trade credit.
