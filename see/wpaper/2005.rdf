Title: De-industrialisation and the post-communist transition: Rowthorn and Wells' model revisited
Abstract: In this paper we present a simple three-sector model explaining the structural change in employment, which is a modified version of Rowthorn-Wells (1987). We supplement the theoretical analysis with simple econometric tests, which illustrate how the modified Rowthorn-Wells model can be used to (i) motivate empirical estimates of the link between the level of development and structures of employment, (ii) illustrate structural distortions under the command economies, and the structural adjustment that happened during the post-Communist transition. We demonstrate that in the case of these economies, the transition process leads to an adjustment to the employment structures predicted by the model.

Title: Upgrading Russian enterprises from the value chain perspective: the case study of tube & pipe, and furniture sectors
Abstract: The paper is the first analysis of the competitiveness of Russian enterprises from the perspective of value chains, with a focus on the example of tube & pipe and furniture producers. In both industries, Russian firms enjoy an advantage on the raw material side. Nevertheless, the overall competitiveness level of Russian producers remains modest. Domestic industries primarily owe decreased competitiveness to the inadequate operation of the final links in the value chain: from end-product production to the end-user. In addition, the competitiveness of domestic producers is limited to the ability of key players in the chain to redistribute additional gains in their own favor. Study shows that any non-selective methods of supporting enterprises (such as tax reductions) exert extremely limited influence on the status of players in those chains where one of the links is characterized by serious entry barriers and related opportunities of rent redistribution in favor of a particular player. Paper suggests several policy measures which aim to improve the ability of the producers to reposition themselves along the chain or to modify the chain itself.

Title: Firms' capabilities related to the economic system: cases from Ukraine and Russia
Abstract: This paper suggests that certain capabilities of the firm are functional to the type of economic system (socialist, capitalist, transitional, etc.) in which the firm has to operate. Their presence in a firm can be an important factor in explaining its ability to survive and develop. It also suggests that concepts and definitions of the firm, offered by writers who have employed evolutionary and institutionalist models, yield useful perspectives on the processes of transition at the level of the individual enterprise. Cases from Russia and Ukraine are used to investigate this conjecture and to identify those capabilities distinctive to a market economy, in contrast with those required by their previous economic system. The capabilities, which have been conspicuously absent from the firms, which were relatively unsuccessful in adapting to the market economy, appear to relate particularly to management of purchasing, of innovation, of quality control, sales and trade credit.
