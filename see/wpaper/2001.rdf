Title: Patterns of Industrial Upgrading in the Clothing Industry in Poland and Romania
Abstract:  This paper aims at understanding the impact of industrial networks with foreign and other domestic organizations on industrial upgrading of the clothing companies in Poland and Romania over the past decade. The research presented in this paper is based on interviews carried out in ten large clothing companies in Poland and Romania. The paper shows that there are differing structural influences of buyer-driven global networks on the industrial upgrading of Polish and Romanian clothing firms. Taking these global buyers as exemplars to themselves, Polish and Romanian clothing firms follow relatively different upgrading patterns, experiencing more or less the same network relationships with foreign buyers whereas differing networks with other organizations in their countries. As the level of accumulation of knowledge and skills differs among the firms, the pace and level of upgrading differs too. This paper has proposed a stylized pattern but it should not be taken as inevitable since it also tries to show that some firms might skip some sequences. As a consequence, it is not a question of the positioning of the countries on a single upgrading ladder, but more accurately it is different upgrading ladders that have been climbed in each country. There is no single pattern for all of them.

Title: Ownership Concentration, ‘Private Benefits of Control' and Debt Financing
Abstract: Building on the ‘law and economics’ literature, this paper analyses corporate governance implications of debt financing in an environment where a dominant owner is able to extract ex ante ‘private benefits of control’. Ownership concentration may result in lower efficiency, measured as a ratio of a firm’s debt to investment, and this effect depends on the identity of the largest shareholder. Moreover, entrenched dominant shareholder(s) may be colluding with fixed-claim holders in extracting ‘control premium’. One of possible outcomes is a ‘crowding out’ of entrepreneurial firms from the debt market, and this is supported by evidence from the transition economies.

Title: Videoton: the Growth of Enterprise through Entrepreneurship and Network Alignment
Abstract: ‘The success stories will not be the vast government organisations that are easy to identify - Robotron in what was once East Germany, Videoton in Hungary, Iskra in Yugoslavia - but companies founded by men and women whose names are as yet unfamiliar’ Harvard Business Review, January – February 1991, p. 26 ‘Micro Capitalism: Eastern Europe’s Computer Future’ by Esther Dyson This quotation from 1991 Harvard Business Review illustrates the mainstream perspective on entrepreneurship in central and eastern Europe (CEE). New small firms led by unknown entrepreneurs will grow through generic expansion while large ex-socialist conglomerates are doomed to bankruptcy. Indeed, this picture reflects to a great extent what has happened to a large number of firms and sectors in CEE. However this metaphor is also excessively simplistic, as the case of Videoton shows. It abstracts from the institutional and network context in which restructuring and entrepreneurship take place. The case of Videoton shows how the growth of enterprises in CEE inevitably rests not only on entrepreneurship but also on the existence and alignment of several other factors. The business model that has been developed through Videoton has greater relevance for understanding the growth of enterprises and the modes of integration of the CEE into the global economy. It shows that the restructuring and subsequent growth of Videoton cannot be explained merely as a case of individual entrepreneurship without taking into account that its success is also based on the alignment of several networks. In the first section we briefly present the company’s history and profile. The second section focuses on the key restructuring in Videoton: a shift to contract manufacturing. Section 3 describes Videoton’s first outward investment. Section 4 addresses the fact that Videoton has managed to survive and grow through a holding structure. Local networks and industrial parks are important factors in explaining Videoton’s strategy (section 5). Its relationships with government are addressed in Section 6. The price of success is retreat from being a producer of final products to being a contract manufacturer. Whether this step back enables further growth is discussed in Section 7. The key strategic problem for a contract manufacturer like Videoton is how to avoid dependent and low value added subcontracting (Section 8). Finally, the growth of Videoton has led to the relocation of several investments and contracts to Hungary (Section 9). Our main conclusion is that the growth of Videoton is best explained through entrepreneurship and alignment of the networks perspective.

Title: The first phase of the internationalisation process: export determinants in firms of the Former Soviet Union
Abstract: A fundamental part of the transition process is for firms to integrate with the world economy. After having been denied access for many years to world markets under totalitarian rule and the auspices of the CMEA, this will require significant advances in labour productivity, product technology, marketing and managerial know how. Following the collapse of the CMEA and the ensuing decline in domestic demand producers in economies of transition have been forced to export to developed markets, in particular to the EU. Some economies of Central and Eastern Europe (in particular Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) have successfully managed to reorientate their trade to Western Europe. In contrast Russia and the European CIS have lagged behind. This study attempts to examine those firms in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus which have succeeded to export to the West. By employing linear, logistic and autoregression factors which figure in the firm's decision process of exporting shall be identified. The impact of ownership, firm characteristics and managerial attitudes on a firm's export propensity and intensity shall also be discussed.

Title: The issues of enterprise growth in transition and post-transition period: the case of Polish 'Elektrim'
Abstract: Case study of Polish company Elektrim illustrates the changing basis of growth of enterprises between the transition and post-transition periods. Elektrim grew primarily through conglomeration in the transition period. After the exhaustion of this mode of growth Elektrim has started to focus on a few core areas (telecoms, cables, energy). The strategic shift to telecommunications has been based on partnerships with foreign firms and it is likely that this will be the pattern in other areas. In this respect, the case of Elektrim shows the importance of internationalisation for the growth of enterprises in CEE. Based on the case study the paper draws several analytical issues: First, Elektrim's shift from conglomeration to focusing suggests that the institutional context, which drives firm strategy in post-socialist economies like Poland, is, perhaps, also changing. Second, in order to grow Elektrim is forced to enter into equity relationships and partnerships like with French Vivendi. This suggests that the possibilities for firm growth in post-socialist economies, like Poland, through generic expansion are still fewer when compared to growth based on mergers & acquisitions or different forms of alliances. Third, Elektrim's relationship with government is complex and refutes the simplified dichotomy of markets vs. governments. This raises the issue of to what extent post-socialist governments operate as a 'compensatory mechanism' on which firms like Elektrim can rely to grow. Fourth, the opening of the CEECs has led to relocations of EU and other MNCs into this region with the result that they are also transferring the oligopolistic competition from EU into new markets. The case of Elektrim shows how CEE companies and goverment regulations become factors in the oligopolistic competition between big EU companies. CEE companies and governments may use this competition to their advantage but also their limited bargaining powers may lead to outcomes unfavourable to them.
