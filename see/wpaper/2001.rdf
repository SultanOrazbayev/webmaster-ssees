Title: The first phase of the internationalisation process: export determinants in firms of the Former Soviet Union
Abstract: A fundamental part of the transition process is for firms to integrate with the world economy. After having been denied access for many years to world markets under totalitarian rule and the auspices of the CMEA, this will require significant advances in labour productivity, product technology, marketing and managerial know how. Following the collapse of the CMEA and the ensuing decline in domestic demand producers in economies of transition have been forced to export to developed markets, in particular to the EU. Some economies of Central and Eastern Europe (in particular Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) have successfully managed to reorientate their trade to Western Europe. In contrast Russia and the European CIS have lagged behind. This study attempts to examine those firms in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus which have succeeded to export to the West. By employing linear, logistic and autoregression factors which figure in the firm's decision process of exporting shall be identified. The impact of ownership, firm characteristics and managerial attitudes on a firm's export propensity and intensity shall also be discussed.

Title: The issues of enterprise growth in transition and post-transition period: the case of Polish 'Elektrim'
Abstract: Case study of Polish company Elektrim illustrates the changing basis of growth of enterprises between the transition and post-transition periods. Elektrim grew primarily through conglomeration in the transition period. After the exhaustion of this mode of growth Elektrim has started to focus on a few core areas (telecoms, cables, energy). The strategic shift to telecommunications has been based on partnerships with foreign firms and it is likely that this will be the pattern in other areas. In this respect, the case of Elektrim shows the importance of internationalisation for the growth of enterprises in CEE. Based on the case study the paper draws several analytical issues: First, Elektrim's shift from conglomeration to focusing suggests that the institutional context, which drives firm strategy in post-socialist economies like Poland, is, perhaps, also changing. Second, in order to grow Elektrim is forced to enter into equity relationships and partnerships like with French Vivendi. This suggests that the possibilities for firm growth in post-socialist economies, like Poland, through generic expansion are still fewer when compared to growth based on mergers & acquisitions or different forms of alliances. Third, Elektrim's relationship with government is complex and refutes the simplified dichotomy of markets vs. governments. This raises the issue of to what extent post-socialist governments operate as a 'compensatory mechanism' on which firms like Elektrim can rely to grow. Fourth, the opening of the CEECs has led to relocations of EU and other MNCs into this region with the result that they are also transferring the oligopolistic competition from EU into new markets. The case of Elektrim shows how CEE companies and goverment regulations become factors in the oligopolistic competition between big EU companies. CEE companies and governments may use this competition to their advantage but also their limited bargaining powers may lead to outcomes unfavourable to them.
