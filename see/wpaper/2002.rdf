Title: Industries, costs and macroeconomic regimes in Central and Eastern European countries: towards stylised facts
Abstract: Economists have difficulties to conceptualise and model the relationship between macroeconomic policy and industry change. This paper explores the relationships between industry cost structures and macroeconomic regimes in central and east European countries (CEECs). It finds that the cost structures are more homogenous within industries than within countries. Changes in cost structures are dominantly intra-industry, i.e. unrelated to changes in industry structures though in some countries structural and specialisation effects are also significant. The paper links the intensity of changes in industry cost structures with a composite measure of macroeconomic stability. In the case of five CEECs, it finds that there is a country-specific relationship between changes in costs and macroeconomic stability. Based on these findings the paper provides arguments for integration of macroeconomic and industrial (technology) policies.

Title: Short-run lats rate movements: impact of foreign currency shocks via trade and financial markets
Abstract: This paper investigates the short-run dynamic impact of foreign currency shocks on the deviations of Latvian lats vis-à-vis US dollar market spot rate from the parity set via lats' peg to SDR for the period from 1994 to 2000. The analysis is based on the standard theoretical model of dynamic cost adjustment, from which empirical models of the autoregressive distributed-lags form are derived. Reduction of several versions of such general models leads to a number of parsimonious and data congruent models. Our main findings from the modelling experiment are: Cross-currency shocks produce extensive impact on the net rate of lats, especially those shocks from the neighbouring transition economies, such as Estonia and Lithuania; These shocks may not be original, and may well act as transmission ports of other foreign currency shocks; The Russian crisis of August 1998 has exerted massive devaluation pressure on lats; The shocks are found to be transmittable via either trade and financial linkages, with the financial channel being the most contagious; Model configurations are found, however, neither unique nor definitely invariant, suggesting that it might be necessary to maintain several models in practice to fulfil different purposes in policy analyses and economic forecasting.

Title: Industrial Integration and Growth of Firm in Transition Economies: The case of a French Multinational Company
Abstract: In the last decade, the prospect of accession of Central and East European countries (CEECs) to the European Union has given momentum to the discussion of their economic integration into the EU. Thus, academic studies have generally focused on variables at the macro level and are conducted in the light of quantitative methodologies in social sciences. This paper instead focuses mainly on the industrial integration of the CEECs into the EU at the firm and inter-organisational level, and uses in-depth, face-to-face interview techniques. Examining the growth of a multinational firm that operates in CEE in the context of networks help us to determine the depth of east-west industrial networks. In this light, the aim of this paper is to contribute to the development of the 'network alignment' framework from the perspective of the multinational companies located and operating in CEE. The growth of the French Soufflet Group in CEECs is taken as an exemplar to demonstrate the need to link the elements of the existing literature on foreign direct investment (multinational companies) with an evolutionary approach, through consideration of evolving and multiple networks.

Title: Innovation strategies in central Europe: a corporate perspective
Abstract: This paper seeks to outline the innovations strategies that various corporations have pursued in Central Europe over the last few decades. It will examine from a corporate perspective the scope and definition of innovation, highlighting how this has changed in today's eclectic ever changing environment. Drawing upon cases studies, this paper will highlight best practice in formulating innovation strategies within Central Europe. In conclusion, it will be argued that in spite of living in an environment where the pressure for companies to constantly reinvent some part of themselves is increasing, companies could greatly benefit from taking time to pause and consider how they can capitalise on the key lessons and best practice considerations that have arisen.

Title: The Russian triple crisis 1998: currency, finance and budget
Abstract: The paper analyzes the Russian currency crisis in August 1998. By critically discussing the existing literature and by descriptively investigating data, the relative importance of economic fundamentals, expectations, structural factors and external causes is assessed. The paper highlights the contradicting requirements on the macroeconomic policy of a transition economy that has a history of inflationary financing. The argument is that none of the previous analyzes has highlighted clearly the triple crisis nature of the events: the crises in the currency and financial markets were inseparably intertwined to the fiscal problems. However, in this emerging market context the budget deficit cannot be stated to be the sole cause in the traditional sense of the so-called first-generation currency crises theories.

Title: Integration of Poland into EU Global Industrial Networks: The Evidence and the Main Challenges
Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to identify the achievements of one decade of transformation of the Polish economy in effecting the integration of its manufacturing sector with those of the broader European and global economy, using the automotive industry as an illustrative example. We begin with a broad picture of the current situation in Poland, looking particularly at the motivations of EU-based investors. We then discuss the automobile industry, again examining the motives of foreign investors and the effects of policy on their behavior. Next, we examine the chief public and private actors in the integration process, with a particular focus on their roles in trying to push Poland's integration in the direction of high value added and high innovation. Finally, we briefly discuss the impact of Poland's accession to the EU on industrial networking, and then summarize our conclusions and suggest a research framework for testing the hypothesis (formulated on the basis of our observations of the Polish case) that the market orientation of a given industry, measured by the ratio of the trade balance in that industry to its total domestic output, depends among other things on ownership structure, with the domestically-owned sector tending to use locally developed technologies and the foreign-owned sector tending to transfer in technology from abroad.

Title: Markets and networks in Romania - life after disorganisation
Abstract: The level of development of Romania is at the moment somewhere in between the one of the fast reforming economies in central Europe and the late reformers in the ex-USSR. Behind this statement however, one can find an uneven growth process, with multi-dimensional distortions and pronounced polarisation. The overall underdevelopment when comparing Romania with Central Europe is the statistical result of a melange of highly efficient performers on one hand and loss-making, strongly resisting to restructuring, economic agents on the other hand, acting together in an unfriendly and unpredictable business environment. There is no doubt that a mix of legal, institutional and political factors, as well as social and cultural ones, contributed to this outcome. In this paper we attempt looking at some aspects of industrial networks integration during transition. Our hypothesis is that, after a stage that could be better characterised, for reasons that will be outlined further, as an incomplete Blanchard disorganisation, the growth of private sector did not compensated for the decline in state sector output. Various constraints and modifications of behavioural characteristics of economic agents affect its potential growth. A stance that reflects a permanent and complex effort of adaptation to pronounced incertitude, and that we call systemic unrest. The main consequence is that the economy is evolving as a chaotic system. Both vertical and horizontal links between economic agents are established under a high moral hazard in an uncertain environment. Due to the implied significant instability of those links, the formation and alignment networks, as it is described by the western literature, is only emerging.

Title: Integration of Slovenia into EU and global industrial networks: review of existing evidence
Abstract: Slovenia is a small economy, which is somehow "condemned" to be open and highly internationalised. Relatively high shares of exports and imports in GDP indicate that the economy is highly dependent on foreign markets and inputs. This orientation is additionally strengthened by the final stage of the transition process and accession to the EU, both meaning definite opening of the economy and its integration into EU and global economy. Internationalisation of operations is, therefore, increasingly becoming a critical factor for creating and stimulating a competitive corporate sector in Slovenia. To strengthen the internationalisation processes, the policy of internationalisation should be based on the following: (i) lifting barriers to internationalisation; (ii) taking the actual needs of companies as a starting point; (iii) flexibility, transparency and the long-term perspective; (iv) adaptability and a re-examination of policy; and (v) a holistic concept of internationalisation. Increasingly important aspects of internationalisation are inward and outward FDI. The paper review the existing evidence on the internationalisation of Slovenian economy in all the various modes. The paper is composed of three parts. In the first part the scale and dynamics of industry integration of Slovenia into EU/global industrial networks by the way of foreign trade, outward and inward processing trade (OPT) and subcontracting and FDI is given. The second part analyses the integration of Slovenian car components industry in international industrial networks, and the third part concentrates on the motivation and strategies of foreign investors in Slovenia and Slovenian investors abroad.

Title: FDI and Industrial Networks in Hungary
Abstract:  The paper summarises some of the key findings of research on the macro and microeconomic effects of FDI, the impact of the MNCs on development, industrial and trade restructuring, and presents a first attempt to draw a map of industrial networks in Hungary. It answers the question whether the rapidly increasing presence of the MNCs did, and will, increase the gap between indigenous and foreign-owned firms in Hungary, or not; and whether the negative effects of a dual-type of economic development could be revised or at least moderated by economic policy Some policy conclusions on the competitive and strategic position of the interviewed firms and their "parents" are drawn from the results.

Title: European Integration and Complementarities Driven Network Alignment: The Case of ABB in Central and Eastern Europe
Abstract: The depth of industry integration between European ‘West’ and ‘East’ depends on the simultaneous existence of several factors, which, through mutual complementarities, align global and local networks. This paper takes the case of Asea Brown Bowery (ABB), one of the first large investors in central and eastern Europe (CEE), to show that the successful penetration of this company into CEE was the result of the simultaneous occurrence of several factors, which had mutually reinforcing complementarities. Changes in the strategy of ABB towards knowledge-based services may be weakening these complementarities and dis-aligning local and global networks in CEE. By integrating the insights of Milgrom and Roberts (1995) on complementarities the paper further develops the ‘network alignment’ perspective (Kim and von Tunzelmann, 1998) on growth.

Title: Consolidation of ownership and market consolidation: the role of relational investors on the Polish beer market 1990-1999
Abstract: This paper presents a case study based on a full dataset related to 31 companies operating in the Polish beer industry during the 1990's. It discusses the impact of privatisation and of secondary ownership transfers on market outcomes. It confirms the critical role played by foreign relational investors in the process of industrial restructuring, and two parallel evolutions: a strong trend towards concentrated ownership and towards market concentration. Companies, which were not initially privatised to relational investors, were typically taken over by them in the later stage. However, the delay led to a postponed restructuring process and a loss of market share.

Title: Performance after mass privatisation : the case of Slovenia
Abstract: Initial ownership structures resulting from the mass privatisation programme were intended as transitional, whereas optimal would be set up gradually and would result from secondary transactions. Therefore, mass privatisation is typically considered successful if secondary transactions lead to improved ownership, in particular, with emergence of strategic investors. If this approach is correct, positive effects of mass privatisation are thus not shown only by companies remaining in control of initial owners but mostly by the companies that have already gone through secondary privatisation. Accordingly, the success of secondary sales is to be evaluated by how successfully companies perform after the sale to new owners. This paper attempts to verify empirically those assumptions. The econometric analysis of panel data, after correcting for a selection bias, shows that TFP (total factor productivity) growth is highest in public companies. In addition we found that the secondary privatisation has had practically no positive effect on economic efficiency in the period 1995-99. We interpret these results as supporting evidence for the theoretical approach, which argues that the impact of strategic investors on performance may be ambiguous and that the quality of the capital market institutions is more important than ownership effects. The former creates incentives for performance by increasing the cost of expropriation of minority shareholders.

Title: Ownership Structure and the Operating Performance of Hungarian Firms
Abstract:  This paper uses firm-level data on 162 large Hungarian enterprises to analyse the relationship between ownership structure and corporate performance in 1998 and 1999. Cross-sectional regressions are run for each of these years using the return on assets (ROA) as the measure of performance. Both after-tax profits and operating profits are used to produce the ROA variable. The signs of the regression coefficients and their significance levels are consistent across the different measures of profit, and also across the two years. The results of the regressions suggest that the presence of foreign ownership may positively affect performance while the existence of continuing State ownership has the opposite effect. Neither of these relationships, however, is statistically significant. Two variables have a significant impact on performance that is consistent across different constructions of the regression models: firm size and capital intensity. The smaller firms in the sample outperform the larger firms, which suggests that the greater monitoring and agency costs likely to be incurred by larger firms negatively impact their performance. The more capital intensive a firm (measured by the log of total assets to employees) the greater is its performance. This positive relationship suggests that high capital intensity may impose a barrier to entry and strengthen the competitive position of companies within their industries. The export intensity of a company (exports to sales revenue) is also positively and significantly related to performance, which suggests that the discipline of competing in foreign markets has a positive impact. However, the inclusion of an industry dummy variable to the regression equations results in the export intensity variable losing its significance.

Title: Changes in Corporate Governance Structures in Polish Privatised Companies
Abstract: The paper presents early results of the survey of 84 Polish privatised industrial companies, sampled from a list of the 500 biggest firms. Three aspects of corporate governance were analysed: ownership structure, management of the companies, and supervision structures. An attempt was made to assess the influence of corporate governance characterisics on companies' performance. The main conclusion of the paper is that privatisation of the largest enterprises resulted in deep changes to their corporate governance structures, and those changes vary with ownership. Most favourable changes in corporate governance structures and performance were discovered in companies with highest levels of ownership concentration, especially in the hands of foreign investors.

Title: Patterns of Preservation, Restructuring and Survival: Science and Technology Policy in Russia in the Post Soviet Era
Abstract:  This paper analyses the role of S&T policy in the adjustment and restructuring of the Russian S&T system in the post-Soviet period. The principal argument is that the adjustment of the S&T system in Russia has been evolving between the ‘preservation of S&T potential’, its restructuring, and survival strategies developed by researchers and R&D organisations. The interaction of these factors explains much of the pace and patterns of restructuring of Russian S&T system observed in the post-Soviet period. The model that emerged is the post-Soviet R&D model, which is relevant for Russia as well as for other CIS. The paper analyses strategic options available to Russian policy makers

Title: Russia and the IMF: Pseudo Lending for Pseudo Reforms
Abstract: This paper argues that the IMF financial and good technical assistance to Russia in the 1990s has been less than generous. Not only the size of the assistance might have not been adequate but also the timing and actual disbursements of these funds were in sharp discord with pledges. More importantly, the IMF made a number of serious policy mistakes in both design and the implementation of the reforms, which significantly contributed to a delay in stabilisation of the economy and were thus costly in terms of the loss of welfare to the society.

Title: Endogenous ownership structure: factors affecting the post-privatisation equity in largest Hungarian firms
Abstract: Using a data set for 162 largest Hungarian firms during the period of 1994-1999 this paper explores the determinants of equity shares held by foreign investors and by Hungarian institutional investors.. We find evidence of a post-privatisation evolution towards more homogeneus equity structures, where dominant categories of owners aim at achieving controlling stakes. Here, the foreign investors and Hungarian institutional investors play the major role. In addition, focusing on firm level characteristics we find that the exporting firms attract foreign owners, who acquire controlling equity stakes. Similarly, the firm size measurements are positively associated with the presence of foreign investors. However, they negatively associated with 100% foreign ownership, since the marginal costs of acquiring additional equity are growing with the size of the assets. We interpret the results in light of the existing theory. In particular, following Demsetz and Lehn (1985) and Demsetz and Villalonga (2001) we argue that equity should not be treated as an exogenous variable. As for specific determinants of equity levels, we focus on informational asymmetries and (unobserved) ownership specific characteristics of foreign investors and Hungarian investors.
