Title: Ownership Structure and the Operating Performance of Hungarian Firms
Abstract:  This paper uses firm-level data on 162 large Hungarian enterprises to analyse the 
relationship between
ownership structure and corporate performance in 1998 and 1999. Cross-sectional regressions are run
for each of these years using the return on assets (ROA) as the measure of performance. Both after-tax
profits and operating profits are used to produce the ROA variable. The signs of the regression
coefficients and their significance levels are consistent across the different measures of profit, and also
across the two years. The results of the regressions suggest that the presence of foreign ownership may
positively affect performance while the existence of continuing State ownership has the opposite effect.
Neither of these relationships, however, is statistically significant. Two variables have a significant
impact on performance that is consistent across different constructions of the regression models: firm
size and capital intensity. The smaller firms in the sample outperform the larger firms, which suggests
that the greater monitoring and agency costs likely to be incurred by larger firms negatively impact
their performance. The more capital intensive a firm (measured by the log of total assets to
employees) the greater is its performance. This positive relationship suggests that high capital intensity
may impose a barrier to entry and strengthen the competitive position of companies within their
industries. The export intensity of a company (exports to sales revenue) is also positively and
significantly related to performance, which suggests that the discipline of competing in foreign markets
has a positive impact. However, the inclusion of an industry dummy variable to the regression
equations results in the export intensity variable losing its significance.

Title: Patterns of Preservation, Restructuring and Survival: Science and Technology Policy in Russia in the Post Soviet Era
Abstract:  This paper analyses the role of S&T policy in the adjustment and restructuring of the Russian S&T system in the post-Soviet period. The principal argument is that the adjustment of the S&T system in Russia has been evolving between the ‘preservation of S&T potential’, its restructuring, and survival strategies developed by researchers and R&D organisations. The interaction of these factors explains much of the pace and patterns of restructuring of Russian S&T system observed in the post-Soviet period. The model that emerged is the post-Soviet R&D model, which is relevant for Russia as well as for other CIS. The paper analyses strategic options available to Russian policy makers

Title: Russia and the IMF: Pseudo Lending for Pseudo Reforms
Abstract: This paper argues that the IMF financial and good technical assistance to Russia in the 1990s has been less than generous. Not only the size of the assistance might have not been adequate but also the timing and actual disbursements of these funds were in sharp discord with pledges. More importantly, the IMF made a number of serious policy mistakes in both design and the implementation of the reforms, which significantly contributed to a delay in stabilisation of the economy and were thus costly in terms of the loss of welfare to the society.

Title: Endogenous ownership structure: factors affecting the post-privatisation equity in largest Hungarian firms
Abstract: Using a data set for 162 largest Hungarian firms during the period of 1994-1999 this paper explores the determinants of equity shares held by foreign investors and by Hungarian institutional investors.. We find evidence of a post-privatisation evolution towards more homogeneus equity structures, where dominant categories of owners aim at achieving controlling stakes. Here, the foreign investors and Hungarian institutional investors play the major role. In addition, focusing on firm level characteristics we find that the exporting firms attract foreign owners, who acquire controlling equity stakes. Similarly, the firm size measurements are positively associated with the presence of foreign investors. However, they negatively associated with 100% foreign ownership, since the marginal costs of acquiring additional equity are growing with the size of the assets. We interpret the results in light of the existing theory. In particular, following Demsetz and Lehn (1985) and Demsetz and Villalonga (2001) we argue that equity should not be treated as an exogenous variable. As for specific determinants of equity levels, we focus on informational asymmetries and (unobserved) ownership specific characteristics of foreign investors and Hungarian investors.
