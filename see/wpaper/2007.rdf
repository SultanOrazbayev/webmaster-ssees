Title: The sustainability of Russia's energy power: implications for the Russian economy
Abstract: To what extent and through what mechanisms has Russian economic growth since 1998 been dependent on Russia's oil and gas industries? Is the likely development of these industries up to 2020 capable of maintaining or increasing Russia's role as an energy supplier? What are the consequences for the rest of the Russian economy - that is, all production except oil and gas - of the leading role played by the hydrocarbons sector now and (probably) in the next decade or so?

Title: 'Oligarchs', Business and Russian Foreign Policy: From El'tsin to Putin
Abstract: The paper investigates the role of private and state-controlled business in the formation and implementation of Russian foreign policy since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The extent to which the 'oligarchs' and business more generally followed their own interests in their external relations or acted as tools of the Russian state is a particular focus. Under President Boris El'tsin, Boris Berezovskii was the only one of the oligarchs to have significant influence on Russian foreign policy. President Vladimir Putin's moves against the oligarchs were motivated partly by the desire to restrict political debate, including on foreign policy, and partly to prevent Mikhail Khodorkovskii from creating a private oil pipeline system which would have subverted Putin's foreign policy, but the main reason was probably the desire to restore state control over key industrial sectors. Under El'tsin, business had followed its own interests, which sometimes conflicted with Russian foreign policy and sometimes reinforced it; but after Putin's attacks on the oligarchs, business seemed more integrated into policy implementation, while still following its own interests where they did not conflict with those of the state, as is suggested by a discussion of Gazprom's foreign policy role.

Title: Policies for promoting technological catch up: a post-Washington approach
Abstract: This paper analyses the evolution of policies for technology catch-up through three periods: import-substitution, (augmented) Washington consensus and post-Washington period. We analyse the dominant policy models and practices in each of these periods as co-evolving with the dominant academic ideas, and changing the conditions for catching-up. We develop several dimensions or building blocks that characterise the policies for technology catch-up. These dimensions are used to characterise each of the three policy periods with the objective of outlining the generic features of an emerging post-Washington approach to technology catch-up policies in relation to past approaches.

Title: Entrepreneurship in Emerging Markets: Which Institutions Matter?
Abstract: In this paper we combine a wide range of country-level institutional indicators with survey data taken from the Global Enterprise Monitor on potential and actual entrepreneurial entry, to investigate the role of the institutions as determinants of the entrepreneurial entry, controlling for individual characteristics. We find that the two most robust institutional features that affect entry are: the size of the financial sector and the protection of property rights. In contrast, we find direct regulatory entry barriers to be insignificant. Interpreting these effects jointly, we argue that the entrepreneurs are forward-looking: in the sense that the business conditions under which they expect their firms to operate matter more than the initial bureaucratic obstacles they have to overcome at time of entry.

Title: Oil and gas: a blessing for few hydrocarbons and within-region inequality in Russia
Abstract: Building on earlier work on regional inequality in Russia (Fedorov 2002; Gaddy and Ickes 2005; Bradshaw 2006 and others) we investigate a novel line of research, i.e. to demonstrate that the regional oil and gas abundance is associated with high within-region inequality. We show empirically that hydrocarbons represent one of the leading determinants of an increased gap between rich and poor in the producing regions. We discuss a possible cluster of geographic, economic and political factors underlying the phenomenon.

Title: Institutions and Entrepreneurship Development in Russia: A Comparative Perspective
Abstract: In this paper we use a comparative perspective to explore the ways in which institutions and networks have influenced entrepreneurial development in Russia. We utilize Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data to study the effects of the weak institutional environment in Russia on entrepreneurship, comparing it first with all available GEM country samples and second, in more detail, with Brazil and Poland. Our results suggest that Russia's institutional environment is important in explaining its relatively low levels of entrepreneurship development, where the latter is measured in terms of both number of start-ups and of existing business owners. In addition, Russia's business environment and its consequences for the role of business networks contribute to the relative advantage of entrepreneurial insiders (those already in business) to entrepreneurial outsiders (newcomers) in terms of new business start-ups.

Title: Corporate Governance and Control in Russian Banks
Abstract: The Working Paper employs the paradigm of new institutional economics to examine peculiarities of the Russian model of corporate governance and control in the banking sector. The study relies upon theoretical as well as applied research of corporate governance in Russian commercial banks featuring different forms of ownership. We focus on real interests of all stakeholders, namely bank and stock market regulators, bank owners, investors, top managers and other insiders. The Anglo-American concept of corporate governance, based on agency theory and implying outside investors' control over banks through stock market, is found to bear limited relevance. We suggest some ways of overcoming the gap between formal institutions of governance and the real life.

Title: Institutions, infrastructure, and trade
Abstract: We examine the influence of infrastructure, institutional quality, colonial and geographic context, and trade preferences on the pattern of bilateral trade. We are interested in threshold effects, and so emphasize those cases where bilateral country pairs do not actually trade. We depart from the institutions and infrastructure literature in this respect, using selection-based gravity modeling of trade flows. We also depart from this literature by mixing principal components (to condense our institutional and infrastructure measures) with a focus on deviations in the resulting indexes from expected values for given income cohorts to control for multicollinearity. We work with a panel of 284,049 bilateral trade flows from 1988 to 2002. Matching bilateral trade and tariff data and controlling for tariff preferences, level of development, and standard distance measures, we find that infrastructure, and institutional quality, are significant determinants not only of export levels, but also of the likelihood exports will take place at all. Our results support the notion that export performance, and the propensity to take part in the trading system at all, depends on institutional quality and access to well developed transport and communications infrastructure. Indeed, this dependence is far more important, empirically, than variations in tariffs in explaining sample variations in North-South trade.

Title: The Great Divide: Ruralisation of Poverty in Russia
Abstract: Using data from the RLMS for the period 2000-2004 we investigate poverty trends in Russia. We find that urban poverty declines at twice the rate of rural poverty so that by 2004 poverty in Russia had become a largely rural phenomenon for the first time since transition began. This finding does not stem from changing population characteristics or shares, is not dependent on the use of a particular poverty line nor is it driven by the rapid expansions that have occurred in Moscow, St. Petersburg or other urban areas. Our findings flesh out those of Ravallion et al (2007) who, in contrast to other regions, "find signs" of a ruralisation of poverty in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. We attribute some of the differential to the labour market.

Title: Research and Development and Competitiveness in South Eastern Europe: Asset or Liability for EU Integration?
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between research and development (R&D) and competitiveness of the SEE economies from the perspective of the EU integration and the EU as a knowledge based economy. Specifically, the paper addresses the question of whether SEE is a potential asset or a liability in this process. SEE countries are quite diverse in terms of levels of competitiveness, with visible effects on the role of R&D which is confirmed by analysis of the demand and supply factors of R&D. Although tentative, results show that innovation policy that takes account of the supply and demand side factors of R&D is essential to knowledge based growth in the SEE economies. This poses some limits to traditionally defined S&T policy as a sectoral activity and calls for new approaches, which are discussed in the paper.

Title: Inequality, democracy and taxation: lessons from the post-communist transition
Abstract: Using data for post-communist economies (1989-2002), we examine the determinants of income inequality. We find a strong positive association between equality and tax collection but note that this relationship is significantly stronger under authoritarian regimes than under democracies. We also discover that early macroeconomic stabilisation resulted in lower inequality; we confirm that education fosters equality and find that larger countries are prone to higher levels of inequality.

Title: National Systems of Innovation and Entrepreneurship: In Search of a Missing Link
Abstract: The literature on national systems of innovation (NIS) has neglected the issue of entrepreneurship because of several incompatibilities between the two notions. The Schumpeterian legacy, the current person-centric view of entrepreneurship, and methodological problems related to treating entrepreneurship at the macro-level, have made it difficult to integrate entrepreneurship into the NIS perspective. At national level it is more appropriate to treat entrepreneurship as a 'property' (dimension) of NIS. In order to link NIS and entrepreneurship we must establish a common conceptual basis. Our argument is that the functional view of NIS and entrepreneurship presents a common basis for such an approach. We develop criteria for the entrepreneurial NIS which we define as being those that can change balance between individual and cooperative entrepreneurship; that enhance both the opportunity and skill aspects of entrepreneurship; and that can balance generation of uncertainty with support to business models and other organisations which pool uncertainty. From the NIS perspective, we explain entrepreneurship as a systemic phenomenon driven by complementarities between technological, market and institutional opportunities. This framework builds on three research traditions in the entrepreneurship/NIS literature (Schumpeterian, Kirznerian and Listian) which jointly form a multi-level, multi-dimensional framework for understanding entrepreneurship from a NIS perspective. This framework could be useful as a heuristic for empirical research on entrepreneurship. Finally, we analyse policies for entrepreneurship and find that they are highly dependent on underlying and previously discussed conceptions of entrepreneurship.

Title: Convergence across Russian regions: a spatial econometrics approach
Abstract: This paper analyses the process of convergence across the regions of Russia using spatial econometrics tools in addition to the traditional β-convergence techniques as derived from the neoclassical theoretical setting. The spatial component appears to be non-negligible and, consequently, conventional convergence estimates suffer a bias due to spatial dependence across observations. Furthermore, variables such as hydrocarbon supply, openness to trade and FDI per capita are found to have an unambiguous, positive and statistically significant impact on growth (Results are also confirmed by the panel counterpart of the model. Estimates for this last are presented in the Appendix E).

Title: Knowledge based entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic and Hungary: results from 4 case studies
Abstract: This paper describes knowledge based entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic and Hungary, in particular the growth and development process of 4 firms are studied: Dekonta, an environmental services firm, Et netera, an IT services firm, both operating in Czech Republic, along with a data recovery firm, Kurt, and a biopharmaceutical firm, Solvo, both operating in Hungary. The objectives of the case studies are to illustrate experiences of knowledge based entrepreneurship within a transition environment in terms of their different growth and development paths. By carrying out in depth case studies using semi structured interviews with the founders, top management teams, core employees and key stakeholders in industrial associations I am able to explain the growth process of entrepreneurial knowledge based ventures. I assume an ecological view of the firm and examine the role of internal, strategic, network and external factors in this development process. I propose that the relative importance of these factors evolve over time from start up to maturity. Moreover, I anticipate that there will be complementarities between these factors in the spirit of Milgrom and Roberts (1995) and Von Tunzelmann (2003). This approach should help us better understand the complex nature of entrepreneurship. The key contributions of these case studies are the application of an ecological conceptual framework to the development of knowledge based firms in Central and Eastern Europe, and so the viability of this model is tested within the transition environment. I follow the recommendations by Ireland et al. (2005) and introduce a temporal element in order to analyse the shift in importance of the factors impacting on firm development and growth, thus hoping to deal with some of the criticisms on existing entrepreneurial research.
