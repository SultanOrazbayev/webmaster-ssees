Title: The sustainability of Russia's energy power: implications for the Russian economy
Abstract: To what extent and through what mechanisms has Russian economic growth since 1998 been dependent on Russia's oil and gas industries? Is the likely development of these industries up to 2020 capable of maintaining or increasing Russia's role as an energy supplier? What are the consequences for the rest of the Russian economy - that is, all production except oil and gas - of the leading role played by the hydrocarbons sector now and (probably) in the next decade or so?

Title: 'Oligarchs', Business and Russian Foreign Policy: From El'tsin to Putin
Abstract: The paper investigates the role of private and state-controlled business in the formation and implementation of Russian foreign policy since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The extent to which the 'oligarchs' and business more generally followed their own interests in their external relations or acted as tools of the Russian state is a particular focus. Under President Boris El'tsin, Boris Berezovskii was the only one of the oligarchs to have significant influence on Russian foreign policy. President Vladimir Putin's moves against the oligarchs were motivated partly by the desire to restrict political debate, including on foreign policy, and partly to prevent Mikhail Khodorkovskii from creating a private oil pipeline system which would have subverted Putin's foreign policy, but the main reason was probably the desire to restore state control over key industrial sectors. Under El'tsin, business had followed its own interests, which sometimes conflicted with Russian foreign policy and sometimes reinforced it; but after Putin's attacks on the oligarchs, business seemed more integrated into policy implementation, while still following its own interests where they did not conflict with those of the state, as is suggested by a discussion of Gazprom's foreign policy role.

Title: Institutions and Entrepreneurship Development in Russia: A Comparative Perspective
Abstract: In this paper we use a comparative perspective to explore the ways in which institutions and networks have influenced entrepreneurial development in Russia. We utilize Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data to study the effects of the weak institutional environment in Russia on entrepreneurship, comparing it first with all available GEM country samples and second, in more detail, with Brazil and Poland. Our results suggest that Russia's institutional environment is important in explaining its relatively low levels of entrepreneurship development, where the latter is measured in terms of both number of start-ups and of existing business owners. In addition, Russia's business environment and its consequences for the role of business networks contribute to the relative advantage of entrepreneurial insiders (those already in business) to entrepreneurial outsiders (newcomers) in terms of new business start-ups.

Title: Corporate Governance and Control in Russian Banks
Abstract: The Working Paper employs the paradigm of new institutional economics to examine peculiarities of the Russian model of corporate governance and control in the banking sector. The study relies upon theoretical as well as applied research of corporate governance in Russian commercial banks featuring different forms of ownership. We focus on real interests of all stakeholders, namely bank and stock market regulators, bank owners, investors, top managers and other insiders. The Anglo-American concept of corporate governance, based on agency theory and implying outside investors' control over banks through stock market, is found to bear limited relevance. We suggest some ways of overcoming the gap between formal institutions of governance and the real life.

Title: Oil and within region Inequality in Russia
Abstract:  Building on earlier work on regional inequality in Russia (Fedorov 2002; Gaddy and
Ickes 2005; Bradshaw 2006 and others) we investigate a novel line of research, i.e. demonstrate that
the regional oil and gas abundance is associated with high within-region inequality. We argue that
this phenomenon is amplified by the following two clusters of factors: on the one hand, by the
monopsonistic position of the extracting companies on the local labour markets coupled with
geographical relocation of rents via transfer pricing from the extracting regions to the companies
headquarters and central government bureaucracy, and, on the other hand, by reduction in financial
support for local communities offered by the extracting companies and by inadequate and illtargeted
transfers by the government.

Title: Entrepreneurship in Emerging Markets:  Which Institutions Matter?
Abstract: In this paper we combine a wide range of country-level institutional indicators with survey
data taken from the Global Enterprise Monitor on potential and actual entrepreneurial entry,
to investigate the role of the institutions as determinants of the entrepreneurial entry,
controlling for individual characteristics. We find that the two most robust institutional
features that affect entry are: the size of the financial sector and the protection of property
rights. In contrast, we find direct regulatory entry barriers to be insignificant. Interpreting
these effects jointly, we argue that the entrepreneurs are forward-looking: in the sense that
the business conditions under which they expect their firms to operate matter more than the
initial bureaucratic obstacles they have to overcome at time of entry.

Title: POLICIES FOR PROMOTING TECHNOLOGICAL CATCHING UP: TOWARDS POST-
WASHINGTON APPROACH
Abstract:  This paper analyses the evolution of policies for technology catch-up through three periods:
import-substitution, (augmented) Washington consensus and post-Washington period. We
analyse the dominant policy models and practices in each of these periods as co-evolving with
the dominant academic ideas, and changing the conditions for catching-up. We develop
several dimensions or building blocks that characterise the policies for technology catch-up.
These dimensions are used to characterise each of the three policy periods with the objective
of outlining the generic features of an emerging post-Washington approach to technology
catch-up policies in relation to past approaches.
