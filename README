It takes anywhere from one day to a full week for the IDEAS, REPEC, ECONPAPERS, and other databases to retrieve and populate new information. If things don't seem to be working as intended, check the logs, where you can usually find offending entries or other errors, as well as some information about when the last update occurred: http://econpapers.repec.org/check/see/.
