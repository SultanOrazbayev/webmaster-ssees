Title:  Phases of Imitation and Innovation in a North-South Endogenous Growth
Model
Abstract:  In this paper, we develop a North-South endogenous growth model to
examine three phases of development in the South: imitation of Northern
products, imitation and innovation and finally, innovation only.
In particular, the model has the features of catching up (and
potentially overtaking) which are of particular relevance to the Pacific Rim
economies.  We show that the possible equilibria
depend on cross-country assimilation effects and the ease of
imitation.  We then apply the model to analyse the impact of R&D
subsidies.  There are some clear global policy implications which emerge
from our analysis.  Firstly, because subsidies to Southern innovation
benefit the North as well, it is beneficial to the North to pay for some of
these subsidies.  Secondly, because the ability of the South to assimilate
Northern knowledge and innovate depends on Southern skills levels, the
consequent spillover benefits on growth make the subsidising
of Southern education by the North particularly attractive.

It takes anywhere from one day to a full week for the IDEAS, REPEC, ECONPAPERS, and other databases to retrieve and populate new information. If things don't seem to be working as intended, check the logs, where you can usually find offending entries or other errors, as well as some information about when the last update occurred: http://econpapers.repec.org/check/see/.
